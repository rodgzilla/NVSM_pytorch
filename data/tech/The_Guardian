'''''The Guardian''''' is a British daily newspaper.  It was founded in 1821 as '''''The Manchester Guardian''''', and took its current name in 1959. Along with its sister papers ''[[The Observer]]'' and ''[[The Guardian Weekly]]'', the ''Guardian'' is part of the [[Guardian Media Group]], owned by the [[Scott Trust Limited|Scott Trust]]. The Scott Trust was created in 1936 "to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of the Guardian free from commercial or political interference".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/2015/jul/26/the-scott-trust The Scott Trust: values and history]</ref> The Scott Trust was converted into a limited company in 2008, with a constitution written so as to project the same protections for ''The Guardian'' as were originally built into the very structure of the Scott Trust by its creators. Profits are reinvested in journalism rather than to benefit an owner or shareholders.<ref>{{cite news|last1=The Guardian News and Media Limited|title=The Scott Trust: values and history|url=https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/2015/jul/26/the-scott-trust|accessdate=20 December 2015|work=The Guardian|date=26 July 2015}}</ref>

==History==

===1821 to 1972===

====Early years====
[[File:The Manchester Guardian, May 5 1821.jpg|thumb|''Manchester Guardian'' Prospectus, 1821]]

''The Manchester Guardian'' was founded in [[Manchester]] in 1821 by cotton merchant [[John Edward Taylor]] with backing from the [[Little Circle]], a group of [[nonconformism|non-conformist]] businessmen.<ref name="G">{{cite news|title=Battle for the memory of Peterloo: Campaigners demand fitting tribute |work=The Guardian |date=13 August 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/13/britishidentity.artnews |accessdate=26 March 2008 | location=London|last=Wainwright|first=Martin}}</ref> They launched their paper after the police closure of the more [[Radicalism (historical)#Popular agitation|radical]] ''[[Manchester Observer]]'', a paper that had championed the cause of the [[Peterloo Massacre]] protesters.<ref>{{cite news|author=Editorial|title=The Manchester Guardian, born 5 May 1821: 190 years&nbsp;– work in progress|date=4 May 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/05/manchester-guardian-work-in-progress}}</ref> Taylor had been hostile to the radical reformers, writing: "They have appealed not to the reason but the passions and the suffering of their abused and credulous fellow-countrymen, from whose ill-requited industry they extort for themselves the means of a plentiful and comfortable existence. They do not toil, neither do they spin, but they live better than those that do."<ref>''Manchester Gazette'', 7 August 1819, quoted in {{cite book| title= 'Guardian' : biography of a newspaper | last= Ayerst | first= David | year= 1971 | publisher=Collins | location= London | isbn= 0-00-211329-5 | page=20}}</ref> When the government closed down the ''Manchester Observer'', the mill-owners' champions had the upper hand.<ref>{{cite book| title= Poor men's guardians : a record of the struggles for a democratic newspaper press, 1763–1973 | last= Harrison |first= Stanley | year= 1974 | publisher=Lawrence and Wishart | location= London | isbn= 0-85315-308-6 | page=53}}</ref>

The influential journalist [[Jeremiah Garnett]] joined Taylor during the establishment of the paper, and all of the Little Circle wrote articles for the new paper.<ref name="dnbGarnett">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Garnett, Jeremiah|last=Garnett|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Garnett (writer)|volume=21|quote=''citing:'' [''Manchester Guardian'', 28 September 1870; ''Manchester Free Lance'', 1 October 1870 ; Prentice's Historical Sketches and Personal Recollections of Manchester; personal knowledge.]}}</ref>

The prospectus announcing the new publication proclaimed that it would "zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty […] warmly advocate the cause of Reform […] endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy and […] support, without reference to the party from which they emanate, all serviceable measures".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Scott Trust: History |publisher=Guardian Media Group |url=http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/ScottTrust/History/tabid/193/Default.aspx |accessdate=26 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728175652/http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/ScottTrust/History/tabid/193/Default.aspx |archivedate=28 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> In 1825 the paper merged with the ''British Volunteer'' and was known as ''The Manchester Guardian and British Volunteer'' until 1828.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/catalog/bib_3593893 |title=The Manchester guardian and British volunteer – JH Libraries |publisher=Catalyst.library.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref>

The working-class ''Manchester and Salford Advertiser'' called the ''Manchester Guardian'' "the foul [[Prostitution|prostitute]] and dirty [[parasite]] of the worst portion of the mill-owners".<ref>21 May 1836</ref> The ''Manchester Guardian'' was generally hostile to labour's claims. Of the 1832 Ten Hours Bill, the paper doubted whether in view of the foreign competition "the passing of a law positively enacting a gradual destruction of the cotton manufacture in this kingdom would be a much less rational procedure."<ref>{{cite news|title=Editorial|work=The Manchester Guardian|date=28 January 1832}}</ref> The ''Manchester Guardian'' dismissed strikes as the work of outside agitators: "[…]&nbsp;if an accommodation can be effected, the occupation of the agents of the Union is gone. They live on strife […]"<ref>{{cite news|title=Editorial|work=The Manchester Guardian|date=26 February 1873}}</ref>

''The Manchester Guardian'' was highly critical of US President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s conduct during the [[American Civil War|US Civil War]] (1861–65), writing on the news that Abraham Lincoln had been assassinated: "Of his rule, we can never speak except as a series of acts abhorrent to every true notion of constitutional right and human liberty […]"<ref>{{cite news|title=Editorial|work=The Manchester Guardian|date=27 April 1865}}</ref>

====C. P. Scott====
[[C. P. Scott]] made the newspaper nationally recognised. He was editor for 57 years from 1872, and became its owner when he bought the paper from the estate of Taylor's son in 1907. Under Scott, the paper's moderate editorial line became more radical, supporting [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] when the Liberals split in 1886, and opposing the [[Second Boer War]] against popular opinion.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hampton, Mark|year=2011|title=The Press, Patriotism, and Public Discussion: C.

Scott thought the Suffragettes' "courage and devotion" was "worthy of a better cause and saner leadership".<ref>Quoted in David Ayerst, ''The Guardian'', 1971, p. 353.</ref> It has been argued that Scott's criticism reflected a widespread disdain, at the time, for those women who "transgressed the gender expectations of [[Edwardian Era|Edwardian society]]".<ref name="suffragettes"/>

Scott commissioned [[J. M. Synge]] and his friend [[Jack Yeats]] to produce articles and drawings documenting the social conditions of the west of Ireland (pre-First World War), and these pieces were published in 1911 in the collection ''Travels in Wicklow, West Kerry and Connemara''.<ref>{{cite news| last =Arnold | first =Bruce | title =To the waters and the wild | newspaper =Irish Independent| location =Dublin| pages = | language = | publisher =Independent News & Media| date =27 November 2012| url =http://www.independent.ie/incoming/to-the-waters-and-the-wild-26527736.html | accessdate =4 June 2014}}</ref>

Scott's friendship with [[Chaim Weizmann]] played a role in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]], and in 1948 ''The Manchester Guardian'' was a supporter of the new State of [[Israel]].

In June 1936 ownership of the paper passed to the [[Scott Trust]] (named after the last owner, John Russell Scott, who was the first chairman of the Trust). This move ensured the paper's independence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust|title=The Scott Trust|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref>

====Spanish Civil War====
Traditionally affiliated with the centrist to centre-left [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], and with a northern, non-conformist circulation base, the paper earned a national reputation and the respect of the left during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939). [[George Orwell]] writes in ''[[Homage to Catalonia#Appendix one|Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938): "Of our larger papers, the ''Manchester Guardian'' is the only one that leaves me with an increased respect for its honesty". With the pro-Liberal ''[[News Chronicle]]'', the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]-supporting ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'', the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]]'s ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Daily Worker]]'' and several Sunday and weekly papers, it supported the Republican government against General [[Francisco Franco]]'s insurgent nationalists.

====Post-war====
The paper's then editor, [[A. P. Wadsworth]], so loathed Labour's [[left-wing]] champion [[Aneurin Bevan]], who had made a reference to getting rid of "Tory Vermin" in a speech "and the hate-gospellers of his entourage" that it encouraged readers to vote Conservative and remove [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]]'s post-war Labour government.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Manchester Guardian|author=Leader|date=22 October 1951|title=Time for change?}}</ref> The newspaper opposed the creation of the [[National Health Service]] as it feared the state provision of healthcare would "eliminate selective elimination" and lead to an increase of congenitally deformed and feckless people.<ref>{{cite book |title=Austerity Britain 1945–1951 |first=David |last=Kynaston |authorlink=David Kynaston |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7475-9923-4 |page=285}}</ref>

''The Manchester Guardian'' strongly opposed military intervention during the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]]: "The Anglo-French ultimatum to Egypt is an act of folly, without justification in any terms but brief expediency. It pours petrol on a growing fire. There is no knowing what kind of explosion will follow."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/10/pressandpublishing.egypt | title=Courage under fire | publisher=The Guardian | date=10 July 2006 | accessdate=5 March 2014 | author=Rusbridger Alan}}. Three years from 1956 and the Manchester Guardian soon became the Guardian, introduced by Scott C.C.P</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=wv7sCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA230&lpg=PA230&dq=The+Manchester+Guardian+strongly+opposed+military+intervention+during+the+1956+Suez+Crisis&source=bl&ots=l_nDOcCMUQ&sig=1bI0RnlijTuu2o1KH3Gi-wP9ddU&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=The%20Manchester%20Guardian%20strongly%20opposed%20military%20intervention%20during%20the%201956%20Suez%20Crisis&f=false |title=Reassessing Suez 1956: New Perspectives on the Crisis and Its Aftermath |last=Smith |first=Simon C. |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |page=230 |isbn=9781317070696}}</ref>

On 24 August 1959, ''The Manchester Guardian'' changed its name to ''The Guardian''. This change reflected the growing prominence of national and international affairs in the newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/2002/jun/11/1|title=Key moments in the Guardian's history: a timeline|date=2017-11-16|website=The Guardian|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref> In September 1961, ''The Guardian'', which had previously only been published in [[Manchester]], began to be printed in [[London]].<ref>''The Press and the People''.

===1972 to 2000===

====Northern Ireland conflict====
When 13 civil rights demonstrators in [[Northern Ireland]] were killed by British soldiers on 30 January 1972 (known as [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]]), ''The Guardian'' said that "Neither side can escape condemnation."<ref name="BloodySunday"/> Of the protesters, they wrote, "The organizers of the demonstration, Miss [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey|Bernadette Devlin]] among them, deliberately challenged the ban on marches. They knew that stone throwing and [[sniping]] could not be prevented, and that the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] might use the [[human shield|crowd as a shield]]."<ref name="BloodySunday">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1972/feb/01/bloodysunday.northernireland1|title=The division deepens|work=The Guardian|date=1 February 1972|author=Leader | location=London}}</ref> Of the army, they wrote, "there seems little doubt that random shots were fired into the crowd, that aim was taken at individuals who were neither bombers nor weapons carriers and that excessive force was used".<ref name="BloodySunday"/>

Many Irish people believed that the [[Widgery Tribunal]]'s ruling on the killings was a whitewash,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/19/newsid_2491000/2491125.stm |title=19 April 1972: 'Bloody Sunday' report excuses Army |publisher=BBC |year=2008 |accessdate=28 July 2009|work=On this day 1950–2005}}</ref> a view that was later supported with the publication of the [[Saville inquiry]] in 2010,<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowcott |first=Owen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/16/bloody-sunday-inquiry-derry-verdict |title=Bloody Sunday inquiry: 'We always knew the dead were innocent' |publisher=The Guardian |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref> but in 1972 ''The Guardian'' declared that "Widgery's report is not one-sided" (20 April 1972).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1972/apr/20/bloodysunday.northernireland|title=To make history repeat itself|work=The Guardian|date=20 April 1972|author=Leader | location=London}}</ref> At the time the paper also supported [[internment]] without trial in Northern Ireland: "Internment without trial is hateful, repressive and undemocratic. In the existing Irish situation, most regrettably, it is also inevitable... .To remove the ringleaders, in the hope that the atmosphere might calm down, is a step to which there is no obvious alternative."<ref>''The Guardian'', leader, 10 August 1971</ref> Before then, ''The Guardian'' had called for British troops to be sent to the region: British soldiers could "present a more disinterested face of law and order,"<ref>''The Guardian'', leader, 15 August 1969</ref> but only on condition that "Britain takes charge."<ref>''The Guardian'', leader, 4 August 1969</ref>

====Sarah Tisdall====
In 1983 the paper was at the centre of a controversy surrounding documents regarding the stationing of [[cruise missile]]s in Britain that were leaked to ''The Guardian'' by civil servant [[Sarah Tisdall]]. The paper eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents to the authorities, which resulted in a six-month prison sentence for Tisdall,<ref>{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Routledge |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/profile-hunter-of-the-truth-lord-justice-scott-with-the-government-rattled-paul-routledge-looks-at-the-man-john-major-now-has-to-face-1407249.html |title=Profile: Hunter of the truth: Lord justice Scott: With the Government rattled, Paul Routledge looks at the man John Major now has to face &#124; Voices |publisher=The Independent |date=16 January 1994 |accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref> though she served only four. "I still blame myself," said [[Peter Preston]], who was the editor of ''The Guardian'' at the time, but he went on to argue that the paper had no choice because it "believed in the rule of law".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/05/pressandpublishing.politicsandthemedia|title=A source of great regret|work=The Guardian|date=5 September 2005| location=London|last=Preston|first=Peter}}</ref>

====First Gulf War====
In the lead-up to the first [[Gulf War]], between 1990 and 1991, ''The Guardian'' expressed doubts about military action against Iraq: "Frustration in the Gulf leads temptingly to the invocation of task forces and tactical bombing, but the military option is no option at all. The emergence yesterday of a potential hostage problem of vast dimensions only emphasised that this is far too complex a crisis for gunboat diplomacy. Loose talk of 'carpet bombing' Baghdad should be put back in the bottle of theoretical but unacceptable scenarios."<ref>{{cite news|title=Choosing the best option|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=6 August 1990|author=Leader}}</ref>

But on the eve of the war, the paper rallied to the war cause: "The simple cause, at the end, is just. An evil regime in Iraq instituted an evil and brutal invasion. Our soldiers and airmen are there, at UN behest, to set that evil to rights. Their duties are clear.&nbsp;... Let the momentum, and the resolution, be swift."<ref>{{cite news|title=Suddenly the sky turns orange|work=The Guardian|date=17 January 1991|author=Leader}}</ref> After the event, journalist [[Maggie O'Kane]] conceded that she and her colleagues had been a mouthpiece for war propaganda: "...&nbsp;we, the media, were harnessed like 2,000 beach donkeys and led through the sand to see what the British and US military wanted us to see in this nice clean war".<ref>"Bloodless words bloody war: In a Guardian/Channel 4 investigation across three continents, Maggie O'Kane follows the trail of lies, cover-ups and carnage that were the truth behind the 'clean' war in the Gulf."

====Alleged penetration by Russian intelligence====
In 1994, [[KGB]] defector [[Oleg Gordievsky]] identified ''Guardian'' literary editor [[Richard Gott]] as "an agent of influence". While Gott denied that he received cash, he admitted he had had lunch at the Soviet Embassy and had taken benefits from the KGB on overseas visits. Gott resigned from his post.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Rhys|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/guardian-journalist-recruited-by-the-kgb-1386978.html|title='Guardian' journalist recruited by the KGB|work=The Independent|date=9 December 1994|accessdate=5 April 2016}}</ref>

====Jonathan Aitken====
In 1995, both the [[Granada Television]] programme ''[[World In Action]]'' and ''The Guardian'' were sued for [[libel]] by the then cabinet minister [[Jonathan Aitken#Libel, arrest and prison|Jonathan Aitken]], for their allegation that [[Harrods]] owner [[Mohamed Al Fayed]] had paid for Aitken and his wife to stay at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Hôtel Ritz]] in Paris, which would have amounted to accepting a bribe on Aitken's part.

The paper supported [[NATO]]'s military intervention in the [[Kosovo War]] in 1998–1999. ''The Guardian'' stated that "the only honourable course for Europe and America is to use military force".<ref>''The Guardian'', leader, 23 March 1999</ref> [[Mary Kaldor]]'s piece was headlined "Bombs away!

====Accusations of anti-Semitism and bias in coverage of Israel====
In recent decades ''The Guardian'' has been accused of biased [[criticism of the Israeli government|criticism of Israeli government policy]]<ref name="Sela">{{cite web|url=http://www.gloria-center.org/meria/2010/06/sela.html |title=ANTI-ZIONIST AND ANTISEMITIC DISCOURSE ON THE GUARDIAN'S COMMENT IS FREE WEBSITE |first=Hadar |last=Sela|work=MERIA Journal| accessdate=18 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713075059/http://www.gloria-center.org/meria/2010/06/sela.html |archivedate=13 July 2010}}</ref> and of bias against the Palestinians.<ref>Ponsford, Dominic (12 August 2014), [http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/guardian-accused-pro-israel-bias-after-carrying-child-sacrifice-ad-rejected-times/ "Guardian accused of pro-Israel bias after carrying 'child sacrifice' ad rejected by The Times"], ''PressGazette''.</ref> In December 2003, columnist [[Julie Burchill]] cited "striking bias against the state of Israel" as one of the reasons she left the paper for ''The Times''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/nov/29/weekend.julieburchill|title=Good, bad and ugly|work=The Guardian|date=29 November 2003|authorlink= Julie Burchill | location=London|last=Burchill|first=Julie}}</ref> A leaked report from the European Monitoring Centre on Racism cited ''The Economist''{{'s}} claim that for "many British Jews," the British media's reporting on Israel "is spiced with a tone of animosity, 'as to smell of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]]'&nbsp;... This is above all the case with the ''Guardian'' and ''[[The Independent]]''". The EU said the report, dated February 2003, was not published because it was insubstantial in its current state and lacking sufficient evidence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/04/eu.politics1|title=Leaked report shows rise in anti-semitism|work=The Guardian|date=4 December 2003| location=London|last=MacAskill|first=Ewen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/report_uk.html |title=Anti-Semitism in the EU: United Kingdom |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date= |accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref>

Responding to these accusations, a ''Guardian'' editorial in 2002 condemned [[anti-Semitism]] and defended the paper's right to criticise the policies and actions of the Israeli government, arguing that those who view such criticism as inherently anti-Jewish are mistaken.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/26/israel.guardianleaders |title=Leader: A new anti-semitism? |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 26 January 2002|accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref> Harriet Sherwood, then ''The Guardian''{{'s}} foreign editor, later its Jerusalem correspondent, has also denied that ''The Guardian'' has an anti-Israel bias, saying that the paper aims to cover all viewpoints in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/values/socialaudit/story/0,,1931208,00.html |title=News coverage |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref>

On 6 November 2011, Chris Elliott, the ''Guardian''{{'}}s readers' editor, wrote that "''Guardian'' reporters, writers and editors must be more vigilant about the language they use when writing about Jews or Israel," citing recent cases where ''The Guardian'' received complaints regarding language chosen to describe Jews or Israel. Elliott noted that, over nine months, he upheld complaints regarding language in certain articles that were seen as anti-Semitic, revising the language and footnoting this change.<ref name="Elliott responds">{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/06/averting-accusations-of-antisemitism-guardian | title=The readers' editor on&nbsp;... averting accusations of antisemitism | publisher=''The Guardian'' | date=6 November 2011 | accessdate=3 October 2012 | author=Elliott, Chris}}</ref>

''The Guardian''{{'}}s style guide section referred to [[Tel Aviv]] as the capital of Israel in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/155043|title=The Guardian seeks to revise history|work=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Corrections and clarifications column editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/apr/22/corrections-and-clarifications |title=Corrections and clarifications &#124; News |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref> ''The Guardian'' later clarified: "In 1980, the Israeli Knesset enacted a law designating the city of Jerusalem, including East Jerusalem, as the country's capital. In response, the UN security council issued resolution 478, censuring the "change in character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem" and calling on all member states with diplomatic missions in the city to withdraw. The UN has reaffirmed this position on several occasions, and almost every country now has its embassy in Tel Aviv. While it was therefore right to issue a correction to make clear Israel's designation of Jerusalem as its capital is not recognised by the international community, we accept that it is wrong to state that Tel Aviv – the country's financial and diplomatic centre – is the capital.

On 11 August 2014 the print edition of ''The Guardian'' published a pro-Israeli advocacy advert during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]] featuring [[Elie Wiesel]], headed by the words "Jews rejected child sacrifice 3,500 years ago.

====Clark County====
In August 2004, for the [[United States presidential election, 2004|US presidential election]], the daily ''G2'' supplement launched an experimental letter-writing campaign in [[Clark County, Ohio]], an average-sized county in a [[swing state]].

====Guardian America====
In 2007, the paper launched ''Guardian America'', an attempt to capitalise on its large online readership in the United States, which at the time stood at more than 5.9 million. The company hired former ''[[American Prospect]]'' editor, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine columnist and ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' writer [[Michael Tomasky]] to head the project and hire a staff of American reporters and web editors. The site featured news from ''The Guardian'' that was relevant to an American audience: coverage of US news and the Middle East, for example.<ref>{{cite web|author=Leon Neyfakh |url=http://observer.com/2007/09/iguardiani-reclaims-america/ |title=Guardian Reclaims America |publisher=Observer |date=5 September 2007 |accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref>

Tomasky stepped down from his position as editor of ''Guardian America'' in February 2009, ceding editing and planning duties to other US and London staff.

====Gagged from reporting Parliament====
In October 2009, ''The Guardian'' reported that it was forbidden to report on a parliamentary matter – a question recorded in a Commons order paper, to be answered by a minister later that week.<ref>{{cite web|author=Table Office, House of Commons |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmordbk2/cmob2.htm |title=Order Paper Part 2 |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref> The paper noted that it was being "forbidden from telling its readers why the paper is prevented—for the first time in memory—from reporting parliament.

In June 2013, the newspaper broke news of the secret collection of [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] telephone records held by [[Barack Obama]]'s administration<ref name="reuters.com"/> and subsequently revealed the existence of the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM surveillance program]] after it was leaked to the paper by former [[National Security Agency|NSA]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]].<ref name="theguardian.com"/> The newspaper was subsequently contacted by the British government's Cabinet Secretary, [[Jeremy Heywood|Sir Jeremy Heywood]], under instruction from Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who ordered that the hard drives containing the information be destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23776063 |title=Edward Snowden files: No 10 contacted Guardian – BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref> ''The Guardian''{{'s}} offices were then visited in July by agents from the UK's [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]], who supervised the destruction of the hard drives containing information acquired from Snowden.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.theage.com.au/news/world-news/rusbridger-tells-of-hard-drive-destruction-4680075.html |title=Guardian's Alan Rusbridger tells of hard drive destruction &#124; Video |publisher=Media.theage.com.au |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=6 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084018/http://media.theage.com.au/news/world-news/rusbridger-tells-of-hard-drive-destruction-4680075.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In June 2014 ''[[The Register]]'' reported that the information the government sought to suppress by destroying the hard drives related to the location of a "beyond top secret" internet monitoring base in [[Seeb]], [[Oman]], and the close involvement of [[BT Group|BT]] and [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable & Wireless]] in intercepting internet communications.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/03/revealed_beyond_top_secret_british_intelligence_middleeast_internet_spy_base|title=Revealed: GCHQ's beyond top secret middle eastern internet spy base|work=The Register|first=Duncan| last=Campbell|authorlink=Duncan Campbell (journalist, born 1944)|date=3 June 2014}}</ref> [[Julian Assange]] criticised the newspaper for not publishing the entirety of the content when it had the chance.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.twitch.tv/reddit/v/113771480|title=I am Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks – Ask Me Anything|date=10 January 2017|last=Assange|first=Julian|type=|language=en|publisher=Reddit|minutes=68|access-date=15 January 2017|via=Twitch}}</ref> The Guardian enquiry later continued because the information had already been copied outside the United Kingdom, earning the newspaper a [[Pulitzer Prize]].

====Manafort–Assange secret meetings====
In a November 2018 ''Guardian'' article [[Luke Harding]] and Dan Collyns cited anonymous sources which stated that [[Donald Trump]]'s former campaign manager [[Paul Manafort]] held secret meetings with [[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]] inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2013, 2015, and 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last1= Harding |first1= Luke |last2= Collyns|first2= Dan |date= 27 November 2018 |title= Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181127143814/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/27/manafort-held-secret-talks-with-assange-in-ecuadorian-embassy |location= |newspaper = The Guardian}}</ref> One reporter characterized the story, "If it’s right, it might be the biggest get this year.

==Ownership and finances==
''The Guardian'' is part of the ''[[Guardian Media Group]]'' (GMG) of newspapers, radio stations and print media including; ''[[The Observer]]'' Sunday newspaper, ''[[The Guardian Weekly]]'' international newspaper, and new media—''Guardian Abroad'' website, and ''[[theguardian.com|guardian.co.uk]]''. All the aforementioned were owned by ''[[Scott Trust Limited|The Scott Trust]]'', a charitable foundation existing between 1936 and 2008, which aimed to ensure the paper's [[editorial independence]] in perpetuity, maintaining its financial health to ensure it did not become vulnerable to take overs by for-profit media groups. At the beginning of October 2008, the ''Scott Trust''{{'}}s assets were transferred to a new limited company, ''The Scott Trust Limited'', with the intention being that the original trust would be wound up.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/08/theguardian.theobserver |title=Guardian owner the ''Scott Trust'' to be wound up after 72 years|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=8 October 2008|accessdate=10 October 2008 |last=Conlan|first=Tara|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref> [[Liz Forgan|Dame Liz Forgan]], chair of the ''Scott Trust'', reassured staff that the purposes of the new company remained the same as under the previous arrangements.

''The Guardian''{{'s}} ownership by the ''Scott Trust'' is probably a factor in its being the only British national daily to conduct (since 2003) an annual social, ethical and environmental [[audit]] in which it examines, under the scrutiny of an independent external auditor, its own behaviour as a company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/values/socialaudit |title=Living Our Values: Social, Ethical and Environmental Audit 2006 |accessdate=11 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006205919/http://www.theguardian.com/values/socialaudit |archivedate=6 October 2014}}</ref> It is also the only British national daily newspaper to employ an internal ombudsman (called the "readers' editor") to handle complaints and corrections.

''The Guardian'' and its parent groups participate in [[Project Syndicate]], established by [[George Soros]], and intervened in 1995 to save the ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'' in South Africa. However, Guardian Media Group sold the majority of its shares of the ''Mail & Guardian'' in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

''The Guardian'' has been consistently loss-making. The National Newspaper division of GMG, which also includes ''The Observer'', reported operating losses of £49.9m in 2006, up from £18.6m in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/gmgplc/media/news/article/article110.html |title=Guardian Media Group 2005/06 results: 28/07/2006: A LANDMARK YEAR FOR GMG |accessdate=9 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821180103/http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/gmgplc/media/news/article/article110.html |archivedate=21 August 2006}}</ref> The paper was therefore heavily dependent on cross-subsidisation from profitable companies within the group.

The continual losses made by the National Newspaper division of the ''Guardian Media Group'' caused it to dispose of its Regional Media division by selling titles to competitor ''[[Trinity Mirror]]'' in March 2010. This included the flagship ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', and severed the historic link between that paper and ''The Guardian''. The sale was in order to safeguard the future of ''The Guardian'' newspaper as is the intended purpose of the ''Scott Trust''.<ref name="M.E.N sold to Trinity Mirror">{{cite news

In June 2011 ''Guardian News and Media'' revealed increased annual losses of £33m and announced that it was looking to focus on its online edition for news coverage, leaving the print edition to contain more comments and features. It was also speculated that ''The Guardian'' might become the first British national daily paper to be fully online.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rayner |first=Gordon |title=Riches to rags as Guardian bleeds £33m in a year |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=18 June 2011 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8583220/Riches-to-rags-as-Guardian-bleeds-33m-in-a-year.html |accessdate=21 October 2011 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Guardian and Observer to adopt 'digital-first' strategy |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=16 June 2011 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/16/guardian-observer-digital-first-strategy?INTCMP=SRCH |accessdate=21 October 2011|last=Sabbagh|first=Dan|location=London|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

For the three years up to June 2012, the paper lost £100,000 a day, which prompted ''Intelligent Life'' to question whether ''The Guardian'' could survive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moreintelligentlife.com/content/ideas/tim-de-lisle/can-guardian-survive |title=Can The Guardian Survive? |publisher=More Intelligent Life |accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref>

Between 2007 and 2014 ''The Guardian Media Group'' sold all their side businesses, of regional papers and online portals for classifieds and consolidated, into ''The Guardian'' as sole product. The sales let them acquire a capital stock of £838.3m as of July 2014, supposed to guarantee the independence of ''The Guardian'' in perpetuity. In the first year, the paper made more losses than predicted, and in January 2016 the publishers announced, that ''The Guardian'' will cut 20 per cent of staff and costs within the next three years.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jane Martinson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/25/guardian-news-media-to-cut-running-costs |title=Guardian News & Media to cut costs by 20 per cent &#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date=25 January 2016 |accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref>  The newspaper is rare in calling for direct contributions "to deliver the independent journalism the world needs." <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.theguardian.com/uk|title=Support the Guardian|website=support.theguardian.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-03}}</ref>

The Guardian Media Group's 2018 annual report (year ending 1 April 2018) indicated some significant changes occurring. Its digital (online) editions accounted for over 50% of group revenues by that time; the loss from news and media operations was £18.6m, 52% lower than during the prior year (2017: £38.9m). The Group had cut costs by £19.1m, partly by switching its print edition to the tabloid format. The Guardian Media Group's owner, the Scott Trust Endowment Fund, reported that its value at the time was £1.01 billion (2017: £1.03bn).<ref>{{cite news |title=Guardian Media Group plc (GMG) results for the financial year ended 1 April 2018 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2018/jul/24/guardian-media-group-plc-gmg-results-for-the-financial-year-ended-1-april-2018 |work=The Guardian |date=24 July 2018}}</ref>

===Foundation funding===
In 2016, the company established a U.S.-based philanthropic arm to raise money from individuals and organizations including think tanks and corporate foundations. The grants are focused by the donors on particular issues. By the following year, the organization had raised $1 million from the likes of [[Pierre Omidyar]]’s Humanity United, the [[Skoll Foundation]], and the [[Conrad N. Hilton Foundation]] to finance reporting on topics including modern-day slavery and climate change. ''The Guardian'' has stated that it has secured $6 million "in multi-year funding commitments" thus far.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/08/could-the-guardians-quest-for-philanthropic-support-squeeze-out-other-news-nonprofits/|title=Could The Guardian’s quest for philanthropic support squeeze out other news nonprofits?|work=Nieman Lab|access-date=2018-08-06}}</ref>

==Political stance and editorial opinion==
Founded by textile traders and merchants, in its early years ''The Guardian'' had a reputation as "an organ of the middle class",<ref>[[Frederick Engels]], ''The Condition of the Working Class in England'', Progress, 1973, p 109.</ref> or in the words of C. P. Scott's son Ted, "a paper that will remain bourgeois to the last".<ref name="Hunter2003">{{cite book|author=Ian Hunter|title=Malcolm Muggeridge: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaEfbtzqEUwC&pg=PA74|year=2003|publisher=Regent College Publishing|isbn=978-1-57383-259-5|page=74}}</ref> Associated at first with the [[Little Circle]] and hence with [[classical liberalism]] as expressed by the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and later by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], its political orientation underwent a decisive change after [[World War II]], leading to a gradual alignment with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and the [[political left]] in general.

The ''[[Scott Trust Limited|Scott Trust]]'' describes one of its "core purposes" to be "to secure the financial and editorial independence of the ''Guardian'' in perpetuity: as a quality national newspaper without party affiliation; remaining faithful to its liberal tradition".<ref>{{cite news|title=The Scott Trust: values and history|url=https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/2015/jul/26/the-scott-trust|accessdate=19 April 2016|work=The Guardian|date=26 July 2015|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name="Affiliation">{{cite news|title=Political affiliation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/17/political-affiliation-guardian-observer|accessdate=19 April 2016|work=The Guardian|date=16 November 2008|language=en-GB}}</ref> The paper's readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion: a [[MORI]] poll taken between April and June 2000 showed that 80 per cent of ''Guardian'' readers were Labour Party voters;<ref name="International Socialism 2003"/> according to another MORI poll taken in 2005, 48 per cent of ''Guardian'' readers were Labour voters and 34 per cent [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] voters.<ref name="Ipsos MORI"/> The newspaper's reputation as a platform for [[Social liberalism|liberal]] opinions has led to the use of the epithets "''Guardian'' reader" and "Guardianista" for people holding such views, or as a stereotype of such people as middle class, earnest and [[politically correct]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo011119/debtext/11119-08.htm#11119-08_spnew3 |title=Hansard 374:54 19 November 2001 |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=19 November 2001 |accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref><ref name="What the papers say"/>

Although the paper is often considered to be "linked inextricably" to the Labour Party,<ref name="Affiliation" /> three of ''The Guardian''{{'s}} four leader writers joined the more centrist [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] on its foundation in 1981.

She also said that "you can be absolutely certain that come the next general election, ''The Guardian''{{'s}} stance will not be dictated by the editor, still less any foreign proprietor (it helps that there isn't one) but will be the result of vigorous debate within the paper".<ref name="Guardianistas">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/29/aretheguardianistasrats|title=Are the Guardianistas rats?|accessdate=13 July 2008|work=The Guardian |location=London | date=29 April 2008|last=Ashley|first=Jackie|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref> The paper's comment and opinion pages, though often written by centre-left contributors such as [[Polly Toynbee]], have allowed some space for right-of-centre voices such as [[Max Hastings|Sir Max Hastings]] and [[Michael Gove]].

===Publication history===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}

[[File:GuardianNewsroom.jpg|thumb|right|''The Guardian''{{'s}} Newsroom visitor centre and archive (No 60), with an old sign with the name ''The Manchester Guardian'']]

The first edition was published on 5 May 1821,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus-educational.com/PRguardian.htm |title=Manchester Guardian |publisher=Spartacus-educational.com |date= |accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref> at which time ''The Guardian'' was a weekly, published on Saturdays and costing 7[[penny|d]]; the [[stamp duty]] on newspapers (4d per sheet) forced the price up so high that it was uneconomic to publish more frequently. When the stamp duty was cut in 1836, ''The Guardian'' added a Wednesday edition and with the abolition of the tax in 1855 it became a daily paper costing 2d.

In October 1952, the paper took the step of printing news on the front page, replacing the adverts that had hitherto filled that space. Then-editor A. P. Wadsworth wrote: "It is not a thing I like myself, but it seems to be accepted by all the newspaper pundits that it is preferable to be in fashion."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/149105|title=The Manchester Guardian; biography of a newspaper|last=David.|first=Ayerst,|date=1971|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801406420|location=Ithaca, N.Y.,|oclc=149105}}</ref>

In 1959, the paper dropped "Manchester" from its title, becoming simply ''The Guardian'', and in 1964 it moved to London, losing some of its regional agenda but continuing to be heavily subsidised by sales of the more downmarket but more profitable ''Manchester Evening News''. The financial position remained extremely poor into the 1970s; at one time it was in merger talks with ''The Times''. The paper consolidated its centre-left stance during the 1970s and 1980s. It was both shocked and revitalised by the launch of ''The Independent'' in 1986 which competed for a similar readership and provoked the entire broadsheet industry into a fight for circulation.
[[File:Sima Wali on the front page of The Guardian newspaper in 2001.jpg|left|thumb|Front page of ''The Guardian'' from 2001, showing the old design of the paper when in broadsheet format. This design was used from 1988 to 2005]]
On 12 February 1988, ''The Guardian'' had a significant redesign; as well as improving the quality of its printers' ink, it also changed its masthead to a juxtaposition of an [[italic type|italic]] [[Garamond]] "''The''", with a bold [[Helvetica]] "Guardian", that remained in use until the 2005 redesign.

In 1992, ''The Guardian'' relaunched its features section as ''G2'', a tabloid-format supplement. This innovation was widely copied by the other "quality" broadsheets and ultimately led to the rise of "compact" papers and ''The Guardian''{{'s}} move to the [[Berliner (format)|Berliner format]]. In 1993 the paper declined to participate in the broadsheet [[price war]] started by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s ''The Times''. In June 1993, ''The Guardian'' bought ''The Observer'' from [[Lonrho]], thus gaining a serious [[Sunday editions|Sunday sister newspaper]] with similar political views.

Its international weekly edition is now titled ''The Guardian Weekly'', though it retained the title ''Manchester Guardian Weekly'' for some years after the home edition had moved to London. It includes sections from a number of other internationally significant newspapers of a somewhat left-of-centre inclination, including ''[[Le Monde]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. ''The Guardian Weekly'' was also linked to a website for expatriates, ''Guardian Abroad'', which was launched in 2007 but had been taken offline by 2012.

===Moving to the Berliner paper format===
[[File:The Guardian 6. 6. 14.jpg|thumb|right|Front page of the 6th June 2014 edition in the Berliner format.]]
''The Guardian'' is printed in full colour,<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> and was the first newspaper in the UK to use the Berliner format for its main section, while producing sections and supplements in a range of page sizes including tabloid, approximately A4, and pocket-size (approximately A5).

In 2004, ''The Guardian'' announced plans to change to a Berliner or "[[midi (newspaper)|midi]]" format, similar to that used by ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'' in Germany, ''[[Le Monde]]'' in France and many other European papers. At 470×315&nbsp;mm, this is slightly larger than a traditional [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]. Planned for the autumn of 2005, this change followed moves by ''The Independent'' and ''[[The Times]]'' to start publishing in tabloid (or compact) format. On Thursday, 1 September 2005, ''The Guardian'' announced that it would launch the new format on Monday 12 September 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/01/theguardian.pressandpublishing|title=New-look Guardian launches on September 12|work=MediaGuardian|date=1 September 2005|last1=Cozens|first1=Claire|location=London|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref> Sister Sunday newspaper ''The Observer'' also changed to this new format on 8 January 2006.

The advantage ''The Guardian'' saw in the Berliner format was that, though it is only a little wider than a tabloid, and is equally easy to read on public transport, its greater height gives more flexibility in page design. The new presses mean that printing can go across the strip down the middle of the centre page, known as the "gutter", allowing the paper to print striking double-page pictures. The new presses also made it the first UK national paper to print in full colour on every page.

The format switch was accompanied by a comprehensive redesign of the paper's look. On Friday, 9 September 2005, the newspaper unveiled its newly designed front page, which débuted on Monday 12 September 2005. Designed by [[Mark Porter (designer)|Mark Porter]], the new look includes a new [[masthead (publishing)|masthead]] for the newspaper, its first since 1988. A typeface family designed by [[Paul Barnes (designer)|Paul Barnes]] and [[Christian Schwartz]] was created for the new design. With just over 200 fonts, it is "one of the most ambitious custom type programs ever commissioned by a newspaper".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Crossgrove|first1=Carl|title=Guardian: review|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/guardian/|website=Typographica|accessdate=11 July 2015}}</ref><ref name="fontshop2006">{{cite web

}}</ref> Especially notable is [[Guardian Egyptian]], a highly legible [[slab serif]] that is used in various weights for both text and headlines and is central to the redesign.

The switch cost ''Guardian Newspapers'' £80&nbsp;million and involved setting up new printing presses in east London and Manchester. This switch was necessary because, before ''The Guardian''{{'s}} move, no printing presses in Britain could produce newspapers in the Berliner format. There were additional complications, as one of the paper's presses was part-owned by ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph Newspapers]]'' and ''[[The Daily Express|Express Newspapers]]'', contracted to use the plant until 2009. Another press was shared with the ''Guardian Media Group's'' north-western tabloid local papers, which did not wish to switch to the Berliner format.

====Reception====
The new format was generally well received by ''Guardian'' readers, who were encouraged to provide feedback on the changes. The only controversy was over the dropping of the ''[[Doonesbury]]'' cartoon strip. The paper reported thousands of calls and emails complaining about its loss; within 24 hours the decision was reversed and the strip was reinstated the following week. ''G2'' supplement editor Ian Katz, who was responsible for dropping it, apologised in the editors' blog saying, "I'm sorry, once again, that I made you—and the hundreds of fellow fans who have called our helpline or mailed our comments' address—so cross."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/values/socialaudit/story/0%2C%2C1600349%2C00.html |title=''Guardian Reborn'', The Guardian |accessdate=5 May 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212135000/http://www.guardian.co.uk/values/socialaudit/story/0%2C%2C1600349%2C00.html |archivedate=12 February 2007 |df= }}.

=== Tabloid format since 2018 ===
In June 2017, [[Guardian Media Group]] (GMG) announced that ''The Guardian'' and ''[[The Observer]]'' would relaunch in [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid format]] from early 2018.<ref name="tabloid">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jun/13/guardian-and-observer-to-relaunch-in-tabloid-format|title=''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'' to relaunch in tabloid format|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=13 June 2017|work=The Guardian}}</ref> ''The Guardian'' confirmed the launch date for the new format to be 15 January 2018.

The format change is intended to help cut cost as it allows the paper to be printed by a wider array of presses, and outsourcing the printing to presses owned by Trinity Mirror is expected to generate millions of pounds in savings annually.

==GuardianFilms==
In 2003, ''The Guardian'' started the film production company GuardianFilms, headed by journalist Maggie O'Kane. Much of the company's output is documentary made for television– and it has included [[Salam Pax]]'s ''[[Baghdad Blogger]]'' for [[BBC Two]]'s daily flagship ''[[Newsnight]]'', some of which have been shown in compilations by ''[[CNN]] International'', ''Sex On The Streets'' and ''Spiked'', both made for the UK's [[Channel 4]] television.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/guardianfilms |title=Films |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 12 February 2009|accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref>

"GuardianFilms was born in a sleeping bag in the Burmese [[rainforest]]," wrote O'Kane in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/11-7-2003-47360.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040228013215/http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/11-7-2003-47360.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 February 2004 |title=Maggie O'Kane: Bringing the Guardian's Ethos to Tv |publisher=Buzzle.com |date=7 November 2003 |accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref> "I was a foreign correspondent for the paper, and it had taken me weeks of negotiations, dealing with shady contacts and a lot of walking to reach the cigar-smoking Karen twins– the boy soldiers who were leading attacks against the country's ruling junta. After I had reached them and written a cover story for the newspaper's ''G2'' section, I got a call from the [[BBC]]'s documentary department, which was researching a film on child soldiers. Could I give them all my contacts?

"The plight of the Karen people, who were forced into slave labour in the rainforest to build pipelines for oil companies (some of them British), was a tale of human suffering that needed to be told by any branch of the media that was interested. I handed over all the names and numbers I had, as well as details of the secret route through [[Thailand]] to get into [[Burma]]. Good girl. Afterwards– and not for the first time– it seemed to me that we at ''The Guardian'' should be using our resources ourselves. Instead of providing contact numbers for any independent TV company prepared to get on the phone to a journalist, we should make our own films."

According to GuardianFilms's own webpage, its international work has focused on training talented local journalists based on the premise that "the era of a traditional London or Washington based foreign correspondent or fireman is coming to an end and the world urgently needs a more searching, challenging journalism brought to us by people who speak the language and can secure access far beyond the 'Green Zone Journalist' limits of the traditional correspondent". It says it is especially focused on reporting the Muslim world in a more challenging manner, and has trained a number of journalists in Iraq, Afghanistan and Zimbabwe.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/guardianfilms |title=Films homepage |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 12 February 2009|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>

GuardianFilms has received several broadcasting awards. In addition to two Amnesty International Media Awards in 2004 and 2005, ''The Baghdad Blogger: Salam Pax'' won a Royal Television Society Award in 2005. ''Baghdad: A Doctor's Story'' won an Emmy Award for Best International Current Affairs film in 2007.<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/video/2008/jan/28/a.doctors.story.guardian.films|title=Excerpt from Baghdad: A Doctor's Story|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=25 May 2010|last1=Salih|first1=Omar|last2=Summers|first2=Ben|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=28 January 2008}}</ref> In 2008, [[Sean Smith (photojournalist and filmmaker)|photojournalist Sean Smith's]] ''Inside the Surge'' won the Royal Television Society award for best international news film&nbsp;– the first time a newspaper has won such an award.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2009/aug/18/afghanistan-war-sean-smith|title=On the frontline with British troops in Afghanistan|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=25 May 2010|last1=Smith|first1=Sean|last2=Nzerem|first2=Keme|last3=Ulleri|first3=Giovanni|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=18 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/20/television.iraqandthemedia |title=Guardian film-maker wins Royal Television Society award &#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date=20 February 2008 |accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref> The same year, ''The Guardian''{{'s}} [[Katine]] website was awarded for its outstanding new media output at the One World Media awards.

==Guardian News & Media Archive==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}

''The Guardian'' and its sister newspaper ''The Observer'' opened ''The Newsroom'', an archive and visitor centre in London, in 2002. The centre preserved and promoted the histories and values of the newspapers through its archive, educational programmes and exhibitions. The Newsroom's activities were all transferred to [[Kings Place]] in 2008.<ref name="test">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/interactive/guardian-interactive-timeline | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Lisa | last=Villani | title=MIC: GNM archive (microsite) | date=20 August 2009}}</ref> Now known as the ''Guardian News & Media Archive'', the archive preserves and promotes the histories and values of ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'' newspapers by collecting and making accessible material that provides an accurate and comprehensive history of the papers. The archive holds official records of ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'' and also seeks to acquire material from individuals who have been associated with the papers. As well as corporate records, the archive holds correspondence, diaries, notebooks, original cartoons and photographs belonging to staff of the papers.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/archive-collections | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=MIC: GNM archive (microsite) | date=26 August 2009}}</ref> This material may be consulted by members of the public by prior appointment. There is also an extensive ''Manchester Guardian'' archive at the [[University of Manchester]]'s [[John Rylands University Library]] and there is a collaboration programme between the two archives. The [[British Library]] also has a large archive of ''The Manchester Guardian'', available in online, hard copy, microform, and CD-ROM in their British Library Newspapers collection.

In November 2007 ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'' made their archives available over the internet via DigitalArchive. The current extent of the archives available are 1821 to 2000 for ''The Guardian'' and 1791 to 2000 for ''The Observer'': these archives will eventually run up to 2003.

The Newsroom's other components were also transferred to Kings Place in 2008. ''The Guardian''{{'s}} Education Centre provides a range of educational programmes for students and adults. ''The Guardian''{{'s}} exhibition space was also moved to Kings Place, and has a rolling programme of exhibitions that investigate and reflect upon aspects of news and newspapers and the role of journalism. This programme often draws on the archive collections held in the GNM Archive.
