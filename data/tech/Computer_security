Due to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, it is also one of the major challenges of the contemporary world.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stevens |first1=Tim |title=Global Cybersecurity: New Directions in Theory and Methods |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=1–4 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1569 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1569|date=2018-06-11 }}</ref>

==Vulnerabilities and attacks==
{{Main|Vulnerability (computing)}}

A vulnerability is a weakness in design, implementation, operation or internal control. Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]] (CVE) database.

An ''exploitable'' vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or "[[Exploit (computer security)|exploit"]] exists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Computer Security and Mobile Security Challenges |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298807979 |website=researchgate.net |accessdate=2016-08-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012010519/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298807979_Computer_Security_and_Mobile_Security_Challenges |archivedate=12 October 2016 |df=dmy-all |date=2015-12-03 }}</ref> Vulnerabilities are often hunted or exploited with the aid of [[Automated threat|automated tools]] or manually using customized scripts.

To secure a computer system, it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it, and these [[threat (computer)|threats]] can typically be classified into one of these categories below:

===Backdoor===
A [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] in a computer system, a [[cryptosystem]] or an algorithm, is any secret method of bypassing normal [[authentication]] or security controls. They may exist for a number of reasons, including by original design or from poor configuration. They may have been added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access, or by an attacker for malicious reasons; but regardless of the motives for their existence, they create a vulnerability.

===Denial-of-service attacks===
[[Denial of service attacks]] (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.<ref>{{cite web |title=Distributed Denial of Service Attack |url=https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-for-business/smes/distributed-denial-of-service-attack |website=csa.gov.sg |accessdate=12 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806080013/https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-for-business/smes/distributed-denial-of-service-attack |archivedate=6 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victims account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of [[Distributed denial of service#Distributed attack|Distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points – and defending is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the [[zombie computer]]s of a [[botnet]], but a range of other techniques are possible including [[Distributed Reflection Denial of Service|reflection and amplification attacks]], where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim.

===Direct-access attacks===
An unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is most likely able to directly copy data from it. They may also compromise security by making [[operating system]] modifications, installing software [[computer worm|worms]], [[keystroke logging|keyloggers]], [[covert listening device]]s or using wireless mice.<ref>[http://gadgtecs.com/2016/03/30/wifi-mouse-leave-billions-risk-computer-hack/ Wireless mouse leave billions at risk of computer hack: cyber security firm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403050123/http://gadgtecs.com/2016/03/30/wifi-mouse-leave-billions-risk-computer-hack/ |date=3 April 2016 }}
</ref> Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be able to be by-passed by booting another operating system or tool from a [[CD-ROM]] or other bootable media. [[Disk encryption]] and [[Trusted Platform Module]] are designed to prevent these attacks.

===Eavesdropping===
[[Eavesdropping]] is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation, typically between hosts on a network. For instance, programs such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]] and [[Narus (company)|NarusInSight]] have been used by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[National Security Agency|NSA]] to eavesdrop on the systems of [[internet service provider]]s. Even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact to the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint [[electromagnetism|electro-magnetic]] transmissions generated by the hardware; [[TEMPEST]] is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks.

=== Multivector, polymorphic attacks ===
Surfacing in 2017, a new class of multi-vector,<ref>{{cite news |title=Multi-Vector Attacks Demand Multi-Vector Protection |work=MSSP Alert |date=July 24, 2018 |url=https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-guests/multi-vector-attacks-demand-multi-vector-protection/ }}</ref> polymorphic<ref>{{cite news |first=Renee |last=Millman |title=New polymorphic malware evades three quarters of AV scanners |work=SC Magazine UK |date=December 15, 2017 |url=https://www.scmagazineuk.com/new-polymorphic-malware-evades-three-quarters-of-av-scanners/article/718757/  }}</ref> cyber threats surfaced that combined several types of attacks and changed form to avoid cybersecurity controls as they spread. These threats have been classified as fifth generation cyberattacks.<ref name=ovum>{{cite news | publisher=Ovum |title=Thinking about cyberattacks in generations can help focus enterprise security plans |first=Rik |last=Turner |date=May 22, 2018 | work=Informa PLC | url=https://ovum.informa.com/resources/product-content/int003-000164 }}</ref>

===Phishing===
[[Phishing]] is the attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details directly from users.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.case.edu/its/kba/its-kba-27196-phishing-attempt/ |title=Identifying Phishing Attempts |publisher=Case |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913200707/http://www.case.edu/its/kba/its-kba-27196-phishing-attempt/ |archivedate=13 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Phishing is typically carried out by [[email spoofing]] or [[instant messaging]], and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. Preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be classified as a form of [[Social engineering (computer security)|social engineering]].

===Privilege escalation===
[[Privilege escalation]] describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their privileges or access level. For example, a standard computer user may be able to fool the system into giving them access to restricted data; or even to "[[superuser|become root]]" and have full unrestricted access to a system.

===Social engineering===
{{Main|Social engineering (security)}}

[[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords, card numbers, etc. by, for example, impersonating a bank, a contractor, or a customer.<ref>{{cite web |last=Arcos Sergio |title=Social Engineering |url=http://upcommons.upc.edu/pfc/bitstream/2099.1/12289/1/73827.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203043630/http://upcommons.upc.edu/pfc/bitstream/2099.1/12289/1/73827.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A common scam involves fake CEO emails sent to accounting and finance departments. In early 2016, the [[FBI]] reported that the scam has cost US businesses more than $2bn in about two years.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scannell|first1=Kara|title=CEO email scam costs companies $2bn|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/83b4e9be-db16-11e5-a72f-1e7744c66818.html#axzz41pN5YBV4|accessdate=7 May 2016|work=Financial Times|issue=25 Feb 2016|date=24 Feb 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623105523/http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/83b4e9be-db16-11e5-a72f-1e7744c66818.html#axzz41pN5YBV4|archivedate=23 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In May 2016, the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] [[NBA]] team was the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the team's president [[Peter Feigin]], resulting in the handover of all the team's employees' 2015 [[Form W-2|W-2]] tax forms.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bucks leak tax info of players, employees as result of email scam|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15615363/milwaukee-bucks-leak-tax-information-players-employees-result-email-scam|accessdate=20 May 2016|agency=Associated Press|date=20 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520144908/http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15615363/milwaukee-bucks-leak-tax-informatiopn-players-employees-result-email-scam|archivedate=20 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Spoofing===
{{Main|Spoofing attack}}
[[Spoofing attack|Spoofing]] is the act of masquerading as a valid entity through falsification of data (such as an [[IP address]] or username), in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain.<ref name="techopedia">{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5398/spoofing|title=What is Spoofing? – Definition from Techopedia|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630134737/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5398/spoofing|archivedate=30 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199688975.001.0001/acref-9780199688975-e-4987|title=spoofing|access-date=8 October 2017|journal=Oxford Reference|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199688975.001.0001|isbn=9780199688975|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2016-01-21}}</ref> There are several types of spoofing, including:

* [[Email spoofing]], where an attacker forges the sending (''From'', or source) address of an email.
* [[IP address spoofing]], where an attacker alters the source IP address in a [[network packet]] to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system.
* [[MAC spoofing]], where an attacker modifies the [[MAC address|Media Access Control (MAC) address]] of their [[network interface]] to pose as a valid user on a network.
* [[Biometrics|Biometric]] spoofing, where an attacker produces a fake biometric sample to pose as another user.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Marcel|editor1-first=Sébastien|editor2-last=Nixon|editor2-first=Mark|editor3-last=Li|editor3-first=Stan|year=2014|title=Handbook of Biometric Anti-Spoofing: Trusted Biometrics under Spoofing Attacks|url=https://link-springer-com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4471-6524-8.pdf|format=PDF|language=English|location=London|publisher=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-1-4471-6524-8|isbn=978-1-4471-6524-8|issn=2191-6594|lccn=2014942635|access-date=8 October 2017|via=Penn State University Libraries|series=Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition}}</ref>

===Tampering===
[[Tampering (crime)|Tampering]] describes a malicious modification of products. So-called [[Evil Maid attack|"Evil Maid" attacks]] and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers are examples.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gallagher |first=Sean |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/ |title=Photos of an NSA "upgrade" factory show Cisco router getting implant |publisher=Ars Technica |date=14 May 2014 |accessdate=3 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804130416/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/ |archivedate=4 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Information security culture==
Employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organizations. Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness towards information security within an organization. ″Exploring the Relationship between Organizational Culture and Information Security Culture″ provides the following definition of information security culture: ″ISC is the totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contribute to the protection of information of all kinds.″<ref>Lim, Joo S., et al. "Exploring the Relationship between Organizational Culture and Information Security Culture." Australian Information Security Management Conference.</ref>

Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of the organization Information Security "effort" and often take actions that ignore organizational Information Security best interests.<ref name=Reimers2017>K. Reimers, D. Andersson (2017) [https://library.iated.org/view/REIMERS2017POS POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION NETWORK SECURITY: THE END USER CHALLENGE AND EVOLVING THREATS], ICERI2017 Proceedings, pp. 1787-1796.</ref>  Research shows Information security culture needs to be improved continuously. In ″Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change″, authors commented, ″It′s a never ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance.″ To manage the information security culture, five steps should be taken: Pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.<ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003">{{cite journal | last1 = Schlienger | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Teufel | first2 = Stephanie | year = 2003 | title = Information security culture-from analysis to change | url = | journal = South African Computer Journal | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 46–52 }}</ref>
*Pre-Evaluation: to identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze the current security policy.
*Strategic Planning: to come up with a better awareness program, clear targets need to be set. Clustering{{definition needed|date=July 2018}} people is helpful to achieve it.
*Operative Planning: a good security culture can be established based on internal communication, management-buy-in, and security awareness and a training program.<ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003"/>
*Implementation: four stages should be used to implement the information security culture. They are:
# Commitment of the management
# Communication with organizational members
# Courses for all organizational members
# Commitment of the employees<ref name="Schlienger, Thomas 2003"/>

==Systems at risk==
The growth in the number of computer systems, and the increasing reliance upon them of individuals, businesses, industries and governments means that there are an increasing number of systems at risk.

===Financial systems===

The computer systems of financial regulators and financial institutions like the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], SWIFT, investment banks, and commercial banks are prominent hacking targets for cybercriminals interested in manipulating markets and making illicit gains.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2996896|title=The New Market Manipulation|first=Tom C. W.|last=Lin|date=3 July 2017|ssrn=2996896|journal= Emory Law Journal |volume=66|p=1253 }}</ref>  Web sites and apps that accept or store [[credit card number]]s, brokerage accounts, and [[bank account]] information are also prominent hacking targets, because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money, making purchases, or selling the information on the [[black market]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Financial Weapons of War |journal=Minnesota Law Review|year= 2016|ssrn=2765010}}</ref> In-store payment systems and [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and [[Personal identification number|PINs]].

===Utilities and industrial equipment===

Computers control functions at many utilities, including coordination of [[telecommmunications]], the [[power grid]], [[nuclear power plant]]s, and valve opening and closing in water and gas networks.  The Internet is a potential attack vector for such machines if connected, but the [[Stuxnet]] worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computers not connected to the Internet can be vulnerable. In 2014, the [[Computer Emergency Readiness Team]], a division of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], investigated 79 hacking incidents at energy companies.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pagliery |first1=Jose |title=Hackers attacked the U.S. energy grid 79 times this year |url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/18/technology/security/energy-grid-hack/ |website=CNN Money |publisher=Cable News Network |accessdate=16 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218070238/http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/18/technology/security/energy-grid-hack |archivedate=18 February 2015 |df=dmy-all |date=2014-11-18 }}</ref>  Vulnerabilities in [[smart meter]]s (many of which use local radio or cellular communications) can cause problems with billing fraud.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.securestate.com/blog/2012/02/16/vulnerabilities-in-smart-meters | title=Vulnerabilities in Smart Meters and the C12.12 Protocol | date=2012-02-16 | accessdate=4 November 2016 | publisher=SecureState | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017100223/https://www.securestate.com/blog/2012/02/16/vulnerabilities-in-smart-meters | archivedate=17 October 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Aviation===
The [[aviation]] industry is very reliant on a series of complex systems which could be attacked.<ref name="Computer Security in Aviation">P. G.

The consequences of a successful attack range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity, [[air traffic control]] outages, loss of aircraft, and even loss of life.

===Consumer devices===
Desktop computers and laptops are commonly targeted to gather passwords or financial account information, or to construct a [[botnet]] to attack another target. [[Smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s, [[smart watch]]es, and other [[mobile devices]] such as [[quantified self]] devices like [[activity tracker]]s have sensors such as cameras, microphones, GPS receivers, compasses, and [[accelerometers]] which could be exploited, and may collect personal information, including sensitive health information. Wifi, Bluetooth, and cell phone networks on any of these devices could be used as attack vectors, and sensors might be remotely activated after a successful breach.<ref name="nestwatch">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/08/06/338334508/is-your-watch-or-thermostat-a-spy-cyber-security-firms-are-on-it|title=Is Your Watch Or Thermostat A Spy?

=== Energy sector ===
In distributed generation systems, the risk of cyber attacks is real, according to ''Daily Energy Insider''. An attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time, and such an attack could have just as severe consequences as a natural disaster. The District of Columbia is considering creating a Distributed Energy Resources (DER) Authority within the city, with the goal being for customers to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility, [[Pepco]], the chance to better estimate energy demand. The D.C. proposal, however, would "allow third-party vendors to create numerous points of energy distribution, which could potentially create more opportunities for cyberattackers to threaten the electric grid."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/13110-d-c-distributed-energy-proposal-draws-concerns-of-increased-cybersecurity-risks/|title=D.C. distributed energy proposal draws concerns of increased cybersecurity risks|last=Brandt|first=Jaclyn|date=2018-06-18|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Impact of security breaches==
Serious financial damage has been caused by [[security breaches]], but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident, the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved. "Several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to [[computer virus|virus]] and [[computer worm|worm]] attacks and to hostile digital acts in general. The 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from $13 billion (worms and viruses only) to $226 billion (for all forms of covert attacks). The reliability of these estimates is often challenged; the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal."<ref>Cashell, B., Jackson, W. D., Jickling, M., & Webel, B. (2004). The Economic Impact of Cyber-Attacks. Congressional Research Service, Government and Finance Division. Washington DC: The Library of Congress.</ref> Security breaches continue to cost businesses billions of dollars but a survey revealed that 66% of security staffs do not believe senior leadership takes cyber precautions as a strategic priority.<ref name="secureworks"/>{{third-party inline|date=October 2017}}

However, reasonable estimates of the financial cost of security breaches can actually help organizations make rational investment decisions. According to the classic [[Gordon-Loeb Model]] analyzing the optimal investment level in information security, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss (i.e., the [[expected value]] of the loss resulting from a cyber/information [[security breach]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Lawrence |last2=Loeb |first2=Martin |title=The Economics of Information Security Investment |journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security |date=November 2002 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=438–457 |doi=10.1145/581271.581274}}</ref>

==Attacker motivation==
As with [[physical security]], the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers. Some are thrill-seekers or [[Vandalism|vandals]], some are activists, others are criminals looking for financial gain. State-sponsored attackers are now common and well resourced, but started with amateurs such as [[Markus Hess]] who hacked for the [[KGB]], as recounted by [[Clifford Stoll]],  in ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg]]''.

A standard part of [[threat modelling]] for any particular system is to identify what might motivate an attack on that system, and who might be motivated to breach it. The level and detail of precautions will vary depending on the system to be secured. A home [[personal computer]], [[bank]], and [[Classified information|classified]] military [[computer network|network]] face very different threats, even when the underlying technologies in use are similar.

==Computer protection (countermeasures)==
In computer security a countermeasure is an action, device, procedure, or technique that reduces a [[Threat (computer)|threat]], a [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]], or an [[attack (computing)|attack]] by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken.<ref name=rfc2828>{{IETF RFC|2828}} Internet Security Glossary</ref><ref name=CNSSI4009>[http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf CNSS Instruction No. 4009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227163121/http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf |date=27 February 2012 }} dated 26 April 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Glossary.pdf|title=InfosecToday Glossary|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120041536/http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Glossary.pdf|archivedate=20 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Some common countermeasures are listed in the following sections:

===Security by design===
{{Main|Secure by design}}

[[Secure by design|Security by design]], or alternately secure by design, means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure.  In this case, security is considered as a main feature.

Some of the techniques in this approach include:
* The [[principle of least privilege]], where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function. That way even if an [[Hacker (computer security)|attacker]] gains access to that part, they have only limited access to the whole system.
* [[Automated theorem proving]] to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems.
* [[Code review]]s and [[unit testing]], approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible.
* [[Defense in depth (computing)|Defense in depth]], where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds.
* Default secure settings, and design to "fail secure" rather than "fail insecure" (see [[fail-safe]] for the equivalent in [[safety engineering]]). Ideally, a secure system should require a deliberate, conscious, knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure.
* [[Audit trail]]s tracking system activity, so that when a security breach occurs, the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined. Storing audit trails remotely, where they can only be appended to, can keep intruders from covering their tracks.
* [[Full disclosure (computer security)|Full disclosure]] of all vulnerabilities, to ensure that the "[[vulnerability (computing)|window of vulnerability]]" is kept as short as possible when bugs are discovered.

===Security architecture===
The Open Security Architecture organization defines IT security architecture as "the design [[Artifact (software development)|artifacts]] that describe how the security controls (security countermeasures) are positioned, and how they relate to the overall [[information technology architecture]]. These controls serve the purpose to maintain the system's quality attributes: confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability and [[assurance services]]".<ref>[http://www.opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/definitions/it-security-architecture Definitions: IT Security Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315012754/http://www.opensecurityarchitecture.org/cms/definitions/it-security-architecture |date=15 March 2014 }}. SecurityArchitecture.org, Jan, 2006</ref>

Techopedia defines security architecture as "a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment. It also specifies when and where to apply security controls. The design process is generally reproducible." The key attributes of security architecture are:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jannsen |first1=Cory |title=Security Architecture |url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/72/security-architecture |website=Techopedia |publisher=Janalta Interactive Inc |accessdate=9 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003064643/http://www.techopedia.com/definition/72/security-architecture |archivedate=3 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
* the relationship of different components and how they depend on each other.
* the determination of controls based on risk assessment, good practice, finances, and legal matters.
* the standardization of controls.

===Security measures===
A state of computer "security" is the conceptual ideal, attained by the use of the three processes: threat prevention, detection, and response.  These processes are based on various policies and system components, which include the following:

* [[User account]] [[access control]]s and [[cryptography]] can protect systems files and data, respectively.
* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can (if properly configured) shield access to internal network services, and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering.  Firewalls can be both hardware- or software-based.
* [[Intrusion Detection System]] (IDS) products are designed to detect network attacks in-progress and assist in post-attack [[forensics]], while [[audit trail]]s and [[data logging|logs]] serve a similar function for individual systems.
* "Response" is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of [[legal]] authorities, counter-attacks, and the like. In some special cases, a complete destruction of the compromised system is favored, as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected.

Today, computer security comprises mainly "preventive" measures, like firewalls or an [[exit procedure]]. A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network, such as the [[Internet]], and can be implemented as software running on the machine, hooking into the [[network stack]] (or, in the case of most [[UNIX]]-based operating systems such as [[Linux]], built into the operating system [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]]) to provide real-time filtering and blocking. Another implementation is a so-called "physical firewall", which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic. Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the [[Internet]].

Some organizations are turning to [[big data]] platforms, such as [[Apache Hadoop]], to extend data accessibility and [[machine learning]] to detect [[advanced persistent threat]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cloudera.com/solutions/cybersecurity.html|title=Cybersecurity at petabyte scale|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713120506/http://www.cloudera.com/solutions/cybersecurity.html|archivedate=13 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.datanami.com/2016/05/09/oni-may-best-hope-cyber-security-now/|title=Why ONI May Be Our Best Hope for Cyber Security Now|last=Woodie|first=Alex|date=9 May 2016|work=|access-date=13 July 2016|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820015812/https://www.datanami.com/2016/05/09/oni-may-best-hope-cyber-security-now/|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

However, relatively few organisations maintain computer systems with effective detection systems, and fewer still have organized response mechanisms in place. As a result, as Reuters points out: "Companies for the first time report they are losing more through electronic theft of data than physical stealing of assets".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/18/us-crime-fraud-idUSTRE69H25820101018 |title=Firms lose more to electronic than physical theft |newspaper=Reuters |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925113829/http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/18/us-crime-fraud-idUSTRE69H25820101018 |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy-all |date=2010-10-18 }}</ref> The primary obstacle to effective eradication of cyber crime could be traced to excessive reliance on firewalls and other automated "detection" systems. Yet it is basic evidence gathering by using [[packet capture appliance]]s that puts criminals behind bars.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Vulnerability management===
{{main|Vulnerability management}}
Vulnerability management is the cycle of identifying, and remediating or mitigating [[Software vulnerability|vulnerabilities]],<ref>Foreman, P: ''Vulnerability Management'', page 1. Taylor & Francis Group, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4398-0150-5}}</ref> especially in [[software]] and [[firmware]]. Vulnerability management is integral to computer security and [[network security]].

Vulnerabilities can be discovered with a [[vulnerability scanner]], which analyzes a computer system in search of known vulnerabilities,<ref name="Codenomicon">Anna-Maija Juuso and Ari Takanen ''Unknown Vulnerability Management'', Codenomicon whitepaper, October 2010 {{cite web |url=http://www.codenomicon.com/solutions/unknown-vulnerability-management/ |title=Defensics Fuzz Testing: Find Hidden Vulnerabilities &#124; Synopsys |accessdate=2011-02-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227073552/http://www.codenomicon.com/solutions/unknown-vulnerability-management/ |archivedate=27 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> such as [[open port]]s, insecure software configuration, and susceptibility to [[malware]].

Beyond vulnerability scanning, many organizations contract outside security auditors to run regular [[penetration test]]s against their systems to identify vulnerabilities. In some sectors, this is a contractual requirement.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=978-1-84928-554-4|title=PCI DSS: A Pocket Guide, 3rd Edition|author=Alan Calder and Geraint Williams|quote=network vulnerability scans at least quarterly and after any significant change in the network|year=2014}}</ref>

===Reducing vulnerabilities===
While [[formal verification]] of the correctness of computer systems is possible,<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/LICS.2003.1210044 |year=2003 |last1=Harrison |first1=J. |pages=45–54|journal=18th Annual IEEE Symposium of Logic in Computer Science, 2003.

[[Two factor authentication]] is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information. It requires "something you know"; a password or PIN, and "something you have"; a card, dongle, cellphone, or other piece of hardware. This increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access.

Social engineering and direct computer access (physical) attacks can only be prevented by non-computer means, which can be difficult to enforce, relative to the sensitivity of the information.  Training is often involved to help mitigate this risk, but even in a highly disciplined environments (e.g. military organizations), social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent.

Enoculation, derived from [[inoculation theory]], seeks to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent tricks or traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts.<ref>Treglia, J., & Delia, M. (2017). Cyber Security Inoculation. Presented at NYS Cyber Security Conference, Empire State Plaza Convention Center, Albany, NY, 3–4 June.</ref>

It is possible to reduce an attacker's chances by keeping systems up to date with security patches and updates, using a security scanner{{definition needed|date=July 2018}} or/and hiring competent people responsible for security.(This statement is ambiguous. Even systems developed by "competent" people get penetrated) The effects of data loss/damage can be reduced by careful [[backup|backing up]] and [[insurance]].

===Hardware protection mechanisms===
{{see also|Computer security compromised by hardware failure}}

While hardware may be a source of insecurity, such as with microchip vulnerabilities maliciously introduced during the manufacturing process,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hacker-in-your-hardware/|title=The Hacker in Your Hardware: The Next Security Threat|journal=Scientific American|volume=303|issue=2|pages=82–88|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312221955/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hacker-in-your-hardware/|archivedate=12 March 2014|df=dmy-all|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0810-82|year=2010|last1=Villasenor|first1=John|bibcode=2010SciAm.303b..82V}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last1=Waksman |first1=Adam |last2=Sethumadhavan |first2=Simha |title=Tamper Evident Microprocessors |volume= |pages= |periodical=Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy |location=Oakland, California |url=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~waksman/PDFs/Oakland_2010.pdf |year=2010 |issn= |doi= |isbn= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055451/http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~waksman/PDFs/Oakland_2010.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> hardware-based or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to software-only computer security. Using devices and methods such as [[dongle]]s, [[trusted platform module]]s, intrusion-aware cases, drive locks, disabling USB ports, and mobile-enabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access (or sophisticated [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor access]]) required in order to be compromised.  Each of these is covered in more detail below.

* USB [[dongle]]s are typically used in software licensing schemes to unlock software capabilities,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.e-spincorp.com/espinv3/index.php/solutions/3-solutions/174-sentinel-hasp-hl |title=Sentinel HASP HL |publisher=E-Spin |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320220549/http://www.e-spincorp.com/espinv3/index.php/solutions/3-solutions/174-sentinel-hasp-hl |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but they can also be seen as a way to prevent unauthorized access to a computer or other device's software.  The dongle, or key, essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key.  The principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle, such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) provides a stronger measure of security, since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it.  Another security application for dongles is to use them for accessing web-based content such as cloud software or [[Virtual Private Networks]] (VPNs).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.safenet-inc.com/multi-factor-authentication/authenticators/pki-usb-authentication/etoken-5200-token-based-authentication/ |title=Token-based authentication |publisher=SafeNet.com |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320234026/http://www.safenet-inc.com/multi-factor-authentication/authenticators/pki-usb-authentication/etoken-5200-token-based-authentication/ |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In addition, a USB dongle can be configured to lock or unlock a computer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewindowsclub.com/lock-protect-your-windows-pc-using-a-usb-drive-with-predator |title=Lock and protect your Windows PC |publisher=TheWindowsClub.com |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320220321/http://www.thewindowsclub.com/lock-protect-your-windows-pc-using-a-usb-drive-with-predator |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all |date=2010-02-10 }}</ref>
* [[Trusted platform module]]s (TPMs) secure devices by integrating cryptographic capabilities onto access devices, through the use of microprocessors, or so-called computers-on-a-chip.  TPMs used in conjunction with server-side software offer a way to detect and authenticate hardware devices, preventing unauthorized network and data access.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/trusted-execution-technology-security-paper.pdf |title=Intel Trusted Execution Technology: White Paper |year=2012 |accessdate=2013-12-18 |author=James Greene |publisher=Intel Corporation |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611161421/http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/trusted-execution-technology-security-paper.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
* [[Computer case#Intrusion detection|Computer case intrusion detection]] refers to a device, typically a push-button switch, which detects when a computer case is opened.  The firmware or BIOS is programmed to show an alert to the operator when the computer is booted up the next time.
* Drive locks are essentially software tools to encrypt hard drives, making them inaccessible to thieves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scmagazine.com/safenet-protectdrive-84/review/2596/ |title=SafeNet ProtectDrive 8.4 |publisher=SCMagazine.com |date=2008-10-04 |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320220133/http://www.scmagazine.com/safenet-protectdrive-84/review/2596/ |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Tools exist specifically for encrypting external drives as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2342798,00.asp |title=Secure Hard Drives: Lock Down Your Data |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2009-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621202140/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2342798,00.asp |archivedate=21 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
* Disabling USB ports is a security option for preventing unauthorized and malicious access to an otherwise secure computer.  Infected USB dongles connected to a network from a computer inside the firewall are considered by the magazine Network World as the most common hardware threat facing computer networks.
* Disconnecting or disabling peripheral devices ( like camera, GPS, removable storage  etc.), that are not in use. <ref> NIST 800-124  https://www.nist.gov/publications/guidelines-managing-security-mobile-devices-enterprise </ref>
* Mobile-enabled access devices are growing in popularity due to the ubiquitous nature of cell phones.  Built-in capabilities such as [[Bluetooth]], the newer [[Bluetooth low energy]] (LE), [[Near field communication]] (NFC) on non-iOS devices and [[biometrics|biometric]] validation such as thumb print readers, as well as [[QR code]] reader software designed for mobile devices, offer new, secure ways for mobile phones to connect to access control systems.  These control systems provide computer security and can also be used for controlling access to secure buildings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/2804966490001/forget-ids-use-your-phone-as-credentials/?playlist_id=937116503001#sp=show-clips |title=Forget IDs, use your phone as credentials |publisher=[[Fox Business Network]] |date=2013-11-04 |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320215829/http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/2804966490001/forget-ids-use-your-phone-as-credentials/?playlist_id=937116503001#sp=show-clips |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Secure operating systems===
{{Main|Security-evaluated operating system}}
One use of the term "computer security" refers to technology that is used to implement secure [[operating system]]s. In the 1980s the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) used the [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria|"Orange Book"]]<ref>{{cite journal |first=Steve |last=Lipner |title=The Birth and Death of the Orange Book |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=19–31 |year=2015 |doi=10.1109/MAHC.2015.27 }}</ref> standards, but the current international standard ISO/IEC 15408, "[[Common Criteria]]" defines a number of progressively more stringent [[Evaluation Assurance Level]]s. Many common operating systems meet the EAL4 standard of being "Methodically Designed, Tested and Reviewed", but the [[formal verification]] required for the highest levels means that they are uncommon. An example of an EAL6 ("Semiformally Verified Design and Tested") system is [[INTEGRITY-178B|Integrity-178B]], which is used in the [[Airbus A380]]<ref name=darkreading>{{cite web |author=Kelly Jackson Higgins |url=http://www.darkreading.com/applications/secure-os-gets-highest-nsa-rating-goes-c/212100421 |title=Secure OS Gets Highest NSA Rating, Goes Commercial |publisher=Dark Reading |date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2013-12-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203031833/http://www.darkreading.com/applications/secure-os-gets-highest-nsa-rating-goes-c/212100421 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Secure coding===
{{Main|Secure coding}}
In software engineering, [[secure coding]] aims to guard against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities. It is also possible to create software designed from the ground up to be secure. Such systems are "[[secure by design]]". Beyond this, [[formal verification]]  aims to prove the [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]] of the [[algorithms]] underlying a system;<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanghavi|first=Alok|title=What is formal verification?|journal=EE Times_Asia|date=21 May 2010}}</ref>
important for [[cryptographic protocol]]s for example.

===Capabilities and access control lists===
{{Main|Access control list|Capability (computers)}}

Within computer systems, two of many [[Computer security model|security models]] capable of enforcing privilege separation are [[access control list]]s (ACLs) and [[capability-based security]]. Using ACLs to confine programs has been proven to be insecure in many situations, such as if the host computer can be tricked into indirectly allowing restricted file access, an issue known as the [[confused deputy problem]]. It has also been shown that the promise of ACLs of giving access to an object to only one person can never be guaranteed in practice. Both of these problems are resolved by capabilities. This does not mean practical flaws exist in all ACL-based systems, but only that the designers of certain utilities must take responsibility to ensure that they do not introduce flaws.<ref name="Yuanzhong Xu, Alan M. Dunn, Owen S. Hofmann, Michael Z. Lee, Syed Akbar Mehdi, and Emmett Witchel">{{cite journal | title=Application-Defined Decentralized Access Control |journal = Proceedings of the Usenix ... Annual Technical Conference. Usenix Technical Conference|volume = 2014|pages = 395–408|date=23 November 2014 | author= Yuanzhong Xu, Alan M. Dunn, Owen S. Hofmann, Michael Z. Lee, Syed Akbar Mehdi, and Emmett Witchel|pmc = 4241348|pmid = 25426493}}</ref>

Capabilities have been mostly restricted to research [[operating system]]s, while commercial OSs still use ACLs. Capabilities can, however, also be implemented at the language level, leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard object-oriented design. An open source project in the area is the [[E programming language|E language]].

===End user security training===
The end-user is widely recognized as the weakest link in the security chain<ref>{{cite web |title=Studies prove once again that users are the weakest link in the security chain |url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/2137210/security-awareness/studies-prove-once-again-that-users-are-the-weakest-link-in-the-security-chain.html |website=CSO Online |accessdate=8 October 2018|date=2014-01-22 }}</ref> and it is estimated that more than 90% of security incidents and breaches involve some kind of human error.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Role of Human Error in Successful Security Attacks |url=https://securityintelligence.com/the-role-of-human-error-in-successful-security-attacks/ |website=IBM Security Intelligence |accessdate=8 October 2018|date=2014-09-02 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=90% of security incidents trace back to PEBKAC and ID10T errors |url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2910316/90-of-security-incidents-trace-back-to-pebkac-and-id10t-errors.html |website=Computerworld |accessdate=8 October 2018|date=2015-04-15 }}</ref> Among the most commonly recorded forms of errors and misjudgment are poor password management, the inability to recognize misleading URLs and to identify fake websites and dangerous email attachments.

As the human component of cyber risk is particularly relevant in determining the global cyber risk<ref>{{cite web |title=The Human Component of Cyber Risk |url=https://www.coruscan.com/cyber-risk/human-component |website=The Coruscan Project |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref> an organization is facing, security awareness training, at all levels, does not only provides formal compliance with regulatory and industry mandates but is considered essential<ref>{{cite news |title=Risky business: why security awareness is crucial for employees |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/feb/12/business-cyber-security-risks-employees |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=8 October 2018|date=2013-02-12 |last1=Caldwell |first1=Tracey }}</ref> in reducing cyber risk and protecting individuals and companies from the great majority of cyber threats.

The focus on the end-user represents a profound cultural change for many security practitioners, who have traditionally approached cybersecurity exclusively from a technical perspective, and moves along the lines suggested by major security centers<ref>{{cite web |title=Developing a Security Culture |url=https://www.cpni.gov.uk/developing-security-culture |website=CPNI - Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure}}</ref> to develop a culture of cyber awareness within the organization, recognizing that a security aware user provides an important line of defense against cyber attacks.

===Response to breaches===
Responding forcefully to attempted [[security breaches]] (in the manner that one would for attempted physical security breaches) is often very difficult for a variety of reasons:
* Identifying attackers is difficult, as they are often in a different [[jurisdiction]] to the systems they attempt to breach, and operate through proxies, temporary anonymous dial-up accounts, wireless connections, and other anonymizing procedures which make backtracing difficult and are often located in yet another jurisdiction.  If they successfully breach security, they are often able to delete [[Data logging|logs]] to cover their tracks.
* The sheer number of attempted attacks is so large that organisations cannot spend time pursuing each attacker (a typical home user with a permanent (e.g., [[cable modem]]) connection will be attacked at least several times per day, so more attractive targets could be presumed to see many more). Note however, that most of the sheer bulk of these attacks are made by automated [[vulnerability scanner]]s and [[computer worm]]s.
* [[Law enforcement officer]]s are often unfamiliar with [[information technology]], and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers.  There are also budgetary constraints.  It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as [[DNA]] testing, and improved [[forensics]] mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a [[network administrator]] or a [[system administrator]]) requires a [[search warrant]] and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.
* The United States government spends the largest amount of money every year on cyber security. The United States has a yearly budget of 28 billion dollars. Canada has the 2nd highest annual budget at 1 billion dollars. Australia has the third highest budget with only 70 million dollars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://macategroup.wordpress.com/2016/07/07/top-3-leading-cybersecurity-countries/|title=Top 3 Leading Cybersecurity Countries|date=7 July 2016|publisher=}}</ref>

==Incident response planning==
Incident response is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack. An incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion, typically escalates to a more impactful event such as a data breach or system failure. The intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to limit damage and reduce recovery time and costs. Responding to compromises quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerabilities, restore services and processes and minimize impact and losses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://talatek.com/risk-management-services/incident-response/|title=TalaTek Incident Response Services|last=Alsinawi|first=Baan|work=TalaTek, LLC|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}</ref>

Incident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practices to stop an intrusion before it causes damage. Typical incident response plans contain a set of written instructions that outline the organization’s response to a cyberattack. Without a documented plan in place, an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholders may not understand their roles, processes and procedures during an escalation, slowing the organizations response and resolution.

There are four key components of a computer security incident response plan:  

# '''Preparation''': Preparing stakeholders on the procedures for handling computer security incidents or compromises
# '''Detection & Analysis''': Identifying and investigating suspicious activity to confirm a security incident, prioritizing the response based on impact and coordinating notification of the incident
# '''Containment, Eradication & Recovery''': Isolating affected systems to prevent escalation and limit impact, pinpointing the genesis of the incident, removing malware, affected systems and bad actors from the environment and restoring systems and data when a threat no longer remains
# '''Post Incident Activity''': Post mortem analysis of the incident, its root cause and the organization’s response with the intent of improving the incident response plan and future response efforts<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://talatek.com/risk-management-services/incident-response/|title=TalaTek Incident Response Services|last=Alsinawi|first=Baan|work=TalaTek, LLC|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}</ref>

<!-- We don't want to list every breach ever – and please keep the descriptions short -->

===Robert Morris and the first computer worm===
{{Main|Morris worm}}
In 1988, only 60,000 computers were connected to the Internet, and most were mainframes, minicomputers and professional workstations. On 2 November 1988, many started to slow down, because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computers – the first internet "[[computer worm]]".<ref name="multiple">Jonathan Zittrain, 'The Future of The Internet', Penguin Books, 2008</ref> The software was traced back to 23-year-old [[Cornell University]] graduate student [[Robert Tappan Morris, Jr.]] who said 'he wanted to count how many machines were connected to the Internet'.<ref name="multiple" />

===Rome Laboratory===
In 1994, over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the [[Rome Laboratory]], the US Air Force's main command and research facility. Using [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]], hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to Rome's networking systems and remove traces of their activities. The intruders were able to obtain classified files, such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s Goddard Space Flight Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, some Defense contractors, and other private sector organizations, by posing as
a trusted Rome center user.<ref>[https://fas.org/irp/gao/aim96084.htm Information Security] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306140354/http://fas.org/irp/gao/aim96084.htm |date=6 March 2016 }}. United States Department of Defense, 1986</ref>

"The malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting," says Jim Walter, director of threat intelligence operations at security technology company McAfee – meaning that the heists could have easily been stopped by existing [[antivirus software]] had administrators responded to the warnings.  The size of the thefts has resulted in major attention from state and Federal United States authorities and the investigation is ongoing.

===Ashley Madison breach===
{{main|Ashley Madison data breach{{!}}Ashley Madison Data Breach}}

In July 2015, a hacker group known as "The Impact Team" successfully breached the extramarital relationship website Ashley Madison, created by [[Avid Life Media]]. The group claimed that they had taken not only company data but user data as well. After the breach, The Impact Team dumped emails from the company's CEO, to prove their point, and threatened to dump customer data unless the website was taken down permanently."<ref>{{Cite journal

==Legal issues and global regulation==
International legal issues of cyber attacks are complicated in nature. There is no global base of common rules to judge, and eventually punish, [[Cybercrime|cyber crimes]] and cyber criminals - and where security firms or agencies do locate the cybercriminal behind the creation of a particular piece of [[malware]] or form of [[Cyber-Attacks|cyber attack]], often the local authorities cannot take action due to lack of laws under which to prosecute.<ref name="ted.com">{{cite web |title=Mikko Hypponen: Fighting viruses, defending the net |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_fighting_viruses_defending_the_net.html |publisher=TED |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116010603/http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_fighting_viruses_defending_the_net.html |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mikko Hypponen – Behind Enemy Lines |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TMFRO66Wv4 |publisher=Hack In The Box Security Conference |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125075257/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TMFRO66Wv4 |archivedate=25 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Proving attribution for cyber crimes and cyber attacks is also a major problem for all law enforcement agencies. "[[Computer viruses]] switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another – moving around the world, using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this. So the Internet is as if someone [had] given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world."<ref name="ted.com" /> The use of techniques such as [[dynamic DNS]], [[fast flux]] and [[Bulletproof hosting|bullet proof servers]] add to the difficulty of investigation and enforcement.

==Role of government==
The role of the government is to make [[Cyber-security regulation|regulations]] to force companies and organizations to protect their systems, infrastructure and information from any [[cyberattack]]s, but also to protect its own national infrastructure such as the national [[Power grid|power-grid]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ensuring the Security of Federal Information Systems and Cyber Critical Infrastructure and Protecting the Privacy of Personally Identifiable Information |url=http://www.gao.gov/highrisk/protecting_the_federal_government_information_systems/why_did_study |publisher=Government Accountability Office |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119221200/http://www.gao.gov/highrisk/protecting_the_federal_government_information_systems/why_did_study |archivedate=19 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Government's regulatory role in [[cyberspace]] is complicated. For some, cyberspace was seen [[virtual space]] that was to remain free of government intervention, as can be seen in many of today's libertarian [[blockchain]] and [[bitcoin]] discussions.<ref name="King ref">{{cite news |url=https://qz.com/1284178/almost-half-of-cryptocurrency-and-bitcoin-bros-identify-as-libertarian/|work=Quartz|first=Georgia |last=King |title=The Venn diagram between libertarians and crypto bros is so close it’s basically a circle |date=23 May 2018}}</ref>   

Many government officials and experts think that the government should do more and that there is a crucial need for improved regulation, mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem. [[Richard A. Clarke|R. Clarke]] said during a panel discussion at the [[RSA Conference|RSA Security Conference]] in [[San Francisco]], he believes that the "industry only responds when you threaten regulation. If the industry doesn't respond (to the threat), you have to follow through."<ref name="Clarke ref">{{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-02-17/business/17361991_1_rsa-security-conference-cybersecurity-counterpane-internet-security |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |first=Carrie |last=Kirby |title=Former White House aide backs some Net regulation / Clarke says government, industry deserve 'F' in cyber security |date=24 June 2011}}</ref>
On the other hand, executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary, but think that the government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently. Daniel R. McCarthy analyzed this public-private partnership in cybersecurity and reflected on the role of cybersecurity in the broader constitution of political order.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McCarthy |first1=Daniel |title=Privatizing Political Authority: Cybersecurity, Public-Private Partnerships, and the Reproduction of Liberal Political Order |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=5–12 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1335 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1335|date=2018-06-11 }}</ref>

===Europe===
On 14 April 2016 the [[European Parliament]] and [[Council of the European Union]] adopted The [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679. GDPR, which became enforceable beginning 25 May 2018, provides for data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). GDPR requires that  business processes that handle personal data be built with data protection by design and by default. GDPR also requires that certain organizations appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO).

[[China]]'s [[Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization]] ({{lang-zh|中央网络安全和信息化领导小组}}) was established on 27 February 2014. This Leading Small Group (LSG) of the [[Communist Party of China]] is headed by [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] himself and is staffed with relevant Party and state decision-makers. The LSG was created to overcome the incoherent policies and overlapping responsibilities that characterized China's former cyberspace decision-making mechanisms. The LSG oversees policy-making in the economic, political, cultural, social and military fields as they relate to network security and IT strategy.

====Legislation====

The 1986 {{USC|18|1030}}, the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] is the key legislation. It prohibits unauthorized access or damage of "protected computers" as defined in {{USCSub|18|1030|e|2}}. Although various other measures have been proposed<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4962/text |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228170910/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4962/text |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-12-28 |title=Text of H.R.4962 as Introduced in House: International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act – U.S. Congress |publisher=OpenCongress |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25 }}</ref><ref>[http://hsgac.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=4ee63497-ca5b-4a4b-9bba-04b7f4cb0123] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120040012/http://hsgac.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=4ee63497-ca5b-4a4b-9bba-04b7f4cb0123|date=20 January 2012}}</ref> – none has succeeded.

In 2013, [[executive order]] [[wikisource:Executive Order 13636|13636]] ''Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity'' was signed, which prompted the creation of the [[NIST Cybersecurity Framework]]

'''Standardized Government Testing Services'''  

The [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) has standardized the "penetration test" service as a pre-vetted support service, to rapidly address potential vulnerabilities, and stop adversaries before they impact US federal, state and local governments. These services are commonly referred to as Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services (HACS) and are listed at the US GSA Advantage website.[[Penetration test#Standardized%20government%20penetration%20test%20services|P]]See more information here: [[Penetration test#Standardized%20government%20penetration%20test%20services|enetration test#Standardized government penetration test services]]

==Modern warfare==
{{Main|Cyberwarfare}}

There is growing concern that cyberspace will become the next theater of warfare. As Mark Clayton from the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' described in an article titled "The New Cyber Arms Race":
<blockquote>
In the future, wars will not just be fought by soldiers with guns or with planes that drop bombs. They will also be fought with the click of a mouse a half a world away that unleashes carefully weaponized computer programs that disrupt or destroy critical industries like utilities, transportation, communications, and energy. Such attacks could also disable military networks that control the movement of troops, the path of jet fighters, the command and control of warships.<ref name="The new cyber arms race">{{cite journal |last1=Clayton |first1=Mark |title=The new cyber arms race |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0307/The-new-cyber-arms-race |journal=The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=16 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416090310/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0307/The-new-cyber-arms-race |archivedate=16 April 2015 |df=dmy-all |date=2011-03-07 }}</ref>

==Terminology==
The following terms used with regards to computer security are explained below:
* Access [[authorization]] restricts access to a computer to a group of users through the use of [[authentication]] systems. These systems can protect either the whole computer, such as through an interactive [[login]] screen, or individual services, such as a [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server. There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as [[passwords]], [[identification card|identification cards]], [[smart card|smart cards]], and [[biometric]] systems.
* [[Anti-virus software]] consists of computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart, and eliminate [[computer viruses]] and other malicious software ([[malware]]).
* [[Application software|Applications]] are [[executable|executable code]], so general practice is to [[Superuser|disallow users the power]] to install them; to install only those which are known to be reputable – and to reduce the [[attack surface]] by installing as few as possible. They are typically run with [[least privilege]], with a robust process in place to identify, test and install any released [[security patch]]es or updates for them.
* [[Authentication]] techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are.]
* [[Automated theorem proving]] and other verification tools can enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications.
* [[Backup|Backups]] are one or more copies kept of important computer files. Typically, multiple copies will be kept at different locations so that if a copy is stolen or damaged, other copies will still exist.
* [[Capability (computers)|Capability]] and [[access control list]] techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control. [[Computer security#Capabilities vs. ACLs|Capabilities vs. ACLs]] discusses their use.
* [[Chain of trust]] techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the system's designers.
* [[Confidentiality]] is the nondisclosure of information except to another authorized person.<ref>{{cite web |title=Confidentiality |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/confidentiality |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref>
* [[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques can be used to defend data in transit between systems, reducing the probability that data exchanged between systems can be intercepted or modified.
* [[Cyberwarfare]] is an internet-based conflict that involves politically motivated attacks on information and information systems. Such attacks can, for example, disable official websites and networks, disrupt or disable essential services, steal or alter classified data, and cripple financial systems.
* [[Data integrity]] is the accuracy and consistency of stored data, indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data record.<ref>{{cite web |title=Data Integrity |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html |accessdate=2011-10-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106055944/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html |archivedate=6 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
[[File:Encryption - decryption.svg|thumb|300px|[[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] techniques involve transforming information, scrambling it so it becomes unreadable during transmission. The intended recipient can unscramble the message; ideally, eavesdroppers cannot.]]
* [[Encryption]] is used to protect the confidentiality of a message. [[Cryptography|Cryptographically]] secure [[cipher|ciphers]] are designed to make any practical attempt of [[cryptanalysis|breaking]] them infeasible. [[symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric-key]] ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using [[shared key|shared keys]], and [[public-key encryption]] using [[digital certificate|digital certificates]] can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance.
* [[Endpoint security]] software aids networks in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry points made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected devices such as laptops, mobile devices, and USB drives.<ref>{{cite web |title=Endpoint Security |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/endpoint_security.html |accessdate=2014-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316021605/http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/endpoint_security.html |archivedate=16 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
* [[Firewall (networking)|Firewalls]] serve as a gatekeeper system between networks, allowing only traffic that matches defined rules. They often include detailed [[Logfile|logging]], and may include [[Intrusion detection system|intrusion detection]] and [[Intrusion detection system#Intrusion prevention|intrusion prevention]] features. They are near-universal between company [[local area networks]] and the Internet, but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if [[network segmentation]] is configured.
* A [[Security hacker|hacker]] is someone who seeks to breach defenses and exploit weaknesses in a computer system or network. 
* [[Honeypot (computing)|Honey pots]] are computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers. They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques.
* [[Intrusion-detection system|Intrusion-detection systems]] are devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.
* A [[microkernel]] is an approach to operating system design which has only the near-minimum amount of code running at the most privileged level – and runs other elements of the operating system such as device drivers, protocol stacks and file systems, in the safer, less privileged [[user space]].
* [[Ping (networking utility)|Pinging]]. The standard "ping" application can be used to test if an IP address is in use. If it is, attackers may then try a [[port scan]] to detect which services are exposed.
* A [[port scan]] is used to probe an IP address for [[Port (computer networking)|open ports]] with the purpose of identifying accessible network services.
* [[Social engineering (computer security)|Social engineering]] is the use of deception to manipulate individuals to breach security.
