[[File:Cloud computing.svg|thumb|Cloud computing metaphor: the group of networked elements providing services need not be individually addressed or managed by users; instead, the entire provider-managed suite of hardware and software can be thought of as an amorphous cloud.]]

'''Cloud computing''' is shared pools of configurable computer [[system resource]]s and higher-level services that can be rapidly [[Provisioning|provisioned]] with minimal management effort, often over the [[Internet]].  Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and [[economies of scale]], similar to a [[public utility]].

==History==

While the term "cloud computing" was popularized with [[Amazon.com]] releasing its [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud|Elastic Compute Cloud]] product in 2006,<ref name="Amazon.com">{{cite web|url=https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2006/08/24/announcing-amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2---beta/
|title=Announcing Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) - beta |publisher=Amazon.com |date=24 August 2006 |access-date=31 May 2014}}</ref> references to the phrase "cloud computing" appeared as early as 1996, with the first known mention in a [[Compaq]] internal document.<ref>
{{Cite news | title=Who Coined 'Cloud Computing'? | author=Antonio Regalado | date= 31 October 2011 | work= Technology Review | publisher= MIT | url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/425970/who-coined-cloud-computing/ | access-date=31 July 2013 }}
</ref>

The cloud symbol was used to represent networks of computing equipment in the original [[ARPANET]] by as early as 1977,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/internet_history/internet_history_70s.html|title=Internet History 1977}}</ref> and the [[CSNET]] by 1981<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gu.friends-partners.org/Bookwriting/PART_I/Chapter_I/Total/Insertions/NSF/CSNET/CSNET.html|title=National Science Foundation, "Diagram of CSNET," 1981}}</ref> — both predecessors to the Internet itself. The word ''cloud'' was used as a metaphor for the Internet and a standardized cloud-like shape was used to denote a network on telephony schematics. With this simplification, the implication is that the specifics of how the end points of a network are connected are not relevant for the purposes of understanding the diagram.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The term ''cloud'' was used to refer to platforms for [[distributed computing]] as early as 1993, when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] spin-off [[General Magic]] and [[AT&T]] used it in describing their (paired) [[Telescript (programming language)|Telescript]] and PersonaLink technologies.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[AT&T]] |title=What Is The Cloud? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a7hK6kWttE |quote=You can think of our electronic meeting place as the Cloud.  PersonaLink was built from the ground up to give handheld communicators and other devices easy access to a variety of services.  [...]  Telescript is the revolutionary software technology that makes intelligent assistance possible.  Invented by General Magic, AT&T is the first company to harness Telescript, and bring its benefits to people everywhere.  [...]  Very shortly, anyone with a computer, a personal communicator, or a television will be able to use intelligent assistance in the Cloud.  And our new meeting place is open, so that anyone, whether individual, entrepreneur, or multinational company, will be able to offer information, goods, and services. |date=1993 |accessdate=2017-10-26}}</ref>  In ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired's]]'' April 1994 feature "Bill and Andy's Excellent Adventure II", [[Andy Hertzfeld]] commented on Telescript, General Magic's distributed programming language:

{{Quote|"The beauty of Telescript&nbsp;... is that now, instead of just having a device to program, we now have the entire Cloud out there, where a single program can go and travel to many different sources of information and create sort of a virtual service. No one had conceived that before. The example Jim White [the designer of Telescript, [[X.400]] and [[ASN.1]]] uses now is a date-arranging service where a software agent goes to the flower store and orders flowers and then goes to the ticket shop and gets the tickets for the show, and everything is communicated to both parties."<ref>Steven Levy (April 1994). [http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.04/general.magic_pr.html "Bill and Andy's Excellent Adventure II"]. ''Wired''.</ref>}}

===Early history===
During the 1960s, the initial concepts of time-sharing became popularized via RJE ([[Remote Job Entry]]);<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc105|title=Network Specifications for Remote Job Entry and Remote Job Output Retrieval at UCSB|last=White|first=J.E.|website=tools.ietf.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref> this terminology was mostly associated with large vendors such as [[IBM]] and [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]].  Full-time-sharing solutions were available by the early 1970s on such platforms as Multics (on GE hardware), Cambridge CTSS, and the earliest UNIX ports (on DEC hardware). Yet, the "data center" model where users submitted jobs to operators to run on IBM mainframes was overwhelmingly predominant.

In the 1990s, telecommunications companies, who previously offered primarily dedicated point-to-point data circuits, began offering [[virtual private network]] (VPN) services with comparable quality of service, but at a lower cost. By switching traffic as they saw fit to balance server use, they could use overall network bandwidth more effectively.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  They began to use the cloud symbol to denote the demarcation point between what the provider was responsible for and what users were responsible for. Cloud computing extended this boundary to cover all servers as well as the network infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/doc/ietf/ipatm/atm-minutes-93jul.txt |publisher=Switch |location=[[Switzerland|CH]] |title=July, 1993 meeting report from the IP over ATM working group of the IETF |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710170149/http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/doc/ietf/ipatm/atm-minutes-93jul.txt |archivedate=2012-07-10 }}</ref> As computers became more diffused, scientists and technologists explored ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} They experimented with algorithms to optimize the infrastructure, platform, and applications to prioritize CPUs and increase efficiency for end users.<ref name="MITCorbato">{{cite web|last=Corbató|first=Fernando J.|title=An Experimental Time-Sharing System|url=http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001/~corbato/sjcc62/|work=SJCC Proceedings|publisher=MIT|accessdate=3 July 2012}}</ref>

The use of the cloud metaphor for virtualized services dates at least to [[General Magic]] in 1994, where it was used to describe the universe of "places" that [[mobile agent]]s in the [[Telescript (programming language)|Telescript]] environment could go. As described by 
[[Andy Hertzfeld]]:
{{quote

The use of the cloud metaphor is credited to General Magic communications employee [http://www.whoisdavidhoffman.com/ David Hoffman], based on long-standing use in networking and telecom. In addition to use by General Magic itself, it was also used in promoting [[AT&T]]'s associated PersonaLink Services.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Steven |last=Levy |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/tech-time-warp-cloud-is-born/ |title=Tech Time Warp of the Week: Watch AT&amp;T Invent Cloud Computing in 1994 |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2014-05-23 |ref=harv |quote=AT&T and the film's director, David Hoffman, pulled out the cloud metaphor–something that had long been used among networking and telecom types.

The goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take benefit from all of these technologies, without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them. The cloud aims to cut costs, and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by IT obstacles.<ref name=HAM2012>{{cite book|last=HAMDAQA|first=Mohammad|title=Cloud Computing Uncovered: A Research Landscape|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier Press|isbn=0-12-396535-7|pages=41–85|url=http://www.stargroup.uwaterloo.ca/~mhamdaqa/publications/Cloud_Computing_Uncovered.pdf}}</ref> The main enabling technology for cloud computing is [[virtualization]]. Virtualization software separates a physical computing device into one or more "virtual" devices, each of which can be easily used and managed to perform computing tasks. With [[operating system–level virtualization]] essentially creating a scalable system of multiple independent computing devices, idle computing resources can be allocated and used more efficiently. Virtualization provides the agility required to speed up IT operations, and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure [[utilization]]. Autonomic computing automates the process through which the user can provision resources [[Code on demand|on-demand]]. By minimizing user involvement, automation speeds up the process, reduces labor costs and reduces the possibility of human errors.<ref name=HAM2012/>

Users routinely face difficult business problems. Cloud computing adopts concepts from [[Service-oriented Architecture]] (SOA) that can help the user break these problems into [[Service (systems architecture)|services]] that can be integrated to provide a solution. Cloud computing provides all of its resources as services, and makes use of the well-established standards and best practices gained in the domain of SOA to allow global and easy access to cloud services in a standardized way.

Cloud computing also leverages concepts from utility computing to provide [[Performance metric|metric]]s for the services used. Such metrics are at the core of the public cloud pay-per-use models. In addition, measured services are an essential part of the feedback loop in autonomic computing, allowing services to scale on-demand and to perform automatic failure recovery. Cloud computing is a kind of [[grid computing]]; it has evolved by addressing the QoS (quality of service) and [[reliability (computer networking)|reliability]] problems. Cloud computing provides the tools and technologies to build data/compute intensive parallel applications with much more affordable prices compared to traditional [[parallel computing]] techniques.<ref name=HAM2012/>

Cloud computing shares characteristics with:

* [[Client–server model]]—''Client–server computing'' refers broadly to any [[distributed application]] that distinguishes between service providers (servers) and service requestors (clients).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://java.sun.com/developer/Books/jdbc/ch07.pdf|publisher=Sun Microsystem|title=Distributed Application Architecture|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>
* [[Computer bureau]]—A [[service bureau]] providing computer services, particularly from the 1960s to 1980s.
* [[Grid computing]]—"A form of distributed and parallel computing, whereby a 'super and virtual computer' is composed of a [[Cluster (computing)|cluster]] of networked, [[Loose coupling|loosely coupled]] computers acting in concert to perform very large tasks."
* [[Fog computing]]—Distributed computing paradigm that provides data, compute, storage and application services closer to client or near-user edge devices, such as network routers. Furthermore, fog computing handles data at the network level, on smart devices and on the end-user client side (e.g. mobile devices), instead of sending data to a remote location for processing.
* [[Mainframe computer]]—Powerful computers used mainly by large organizations for critical applications, typically bulk data processing such as: [[census]]; industry and consumer statistics; police and secret intelligence services; [[enterprise resource planning]]; and financial [[transaction processing]].

Cloud computing exhibits the following key characteristics:
* Agility for organizations may be improved, as cloud computing may increase users' flexibility with re-provisioning, adding, or expanding technological infrastructure resources.
* Cost reductions are claimed by cloud providers. A public-cloud delivery model converts [[capital expenditure]]s (e.g., buying servers) to [[operational expenditure]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cloudave.com/link/recession-is-good-for-cloud-computing-microsoft-agrees |title=Recession Is Good For Cloud Computing – Microsoft Agrees |publisher=CloudAve |accessdate=2010-08-22|date=2009-02-12 }}</ref> This purportedly lowers [[barriers to entry]], as infrastructure is typically provided by a third party and need not be purchased for one-time or infrequent intensive computing tasks.

* [[Computer security|Security]] can improve due to centralization of data, increased security-focused resources, etc., but concerns can persist about loss of control over certain sensitive data, and the lack of security for stored [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]]s. Security is often as good as or better than other traditional systems, in part because service providers are able to devote resources to solving security issues that many customers cannot afford to tackle or which they lack the technical skills to address.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mills |first=Elinor |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10150569-83.html |title=Cloud computing security forecast: Clear skies |publisher=CNET News |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> However, the complexity of security is greatly increased when data is distributed over a wider area or over a greater number of devices, as well as in multi-tenant systems shared by unrelated users. In addition, user access to security [[audit log]]s may be difficult or impossible. Private cloud installations are in part motivated by users' desire to retain control over the infrastructure and avoid losing control of information security.

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]'s definition of cloud computing identifies "five essential characteristics":

{{Quote|text=''On-demand self-service.'' A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

''Broad network access.'' Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, [[laptop]]s, and workstations).

''[[Pooling (resource management)|Resource pooling]].'' The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.&nbsp;

''Rapid elasticity.'' Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

''Measured service.'' Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.|sign=National Institute of Standards and Technology<ref name="nist"  >{{cite techreport |title=The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing |number=Special publication 800-145|institution=National Institute of Standards and Technology: U.S. Department of Commerce|date= September 2011|author1= Peter Mell |author2= Timothy Grance |doi= 10.6028/NIST.SP.800-145}}</ref>}}

For example, one can provide SaaS implemented on physical machines (bare metal), without using underlying PaaS or IaaS layers, and conversely one can run a program on IaaS and access it directly, without wrapping it as SaaS.

===Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)===
{{Main|Infrastructure as a service}}

"Infrastructure as a service" (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level [[api|APIs]] used to [[indirection|dereference]] various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A [[hypervisor]] runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single [[Linux kernel]] running directly on the physical hardware. Linux [[cgroups]] and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and manage the containers. Containerisation offers higher performance than virtualization, because there is no hypervisor overhead. Also, container capacity auto-scales dynamically with computing load, which eliminates the problem of over-provisioning and enables usage-based billing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elastichosts.com/blog/elastic-containers/#thetechnicaldetails|title=ElasticHosts Blog|date=2014-04-01|website=Elastichosts|access-date=2016-06-02}}</ref> IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine [[disk image|disk-image]] library, raw [[block storage]], file or [[object storage]], firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, [[VLAN|virtual local area networks]] (VLANs), and software bundles.<ref name="DHAC">

The [[NIST]]'s definition of cloud computing describes IaaS as "where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls)."<ref name="nist"/>

IaaS-cloud providers supply these resources on-demand from their large pools of equipment installed in [[data centers]]. For [[Wide area network|wide-area]] connectivity, customers can use either the Internet or [[carrier cloud]]s (dedicated [[virtual private network]]s). To deploy their applications, cloud users install operating-system images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure. In this model, the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software. Cloud providers typically bill IaaS services on a utility computing basis: cost reflects the amount of resources allocated and consumed.{{citation needed|date=May 2018|reason=Source should be third-party, not example-spam}}

===Platform as a service (PaaS)===
{{Main|Platform as a service}}

The [[NIST]]'s definition of cloud computing defines Platform as a Service as:<ref name="nist"/>

{{quote|text=The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.}}

PaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers. The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment. In the PaaS models, cloud providers deliver a [[computing platform]], typically including operating system, programming-language execution environment, database, and web server. Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. With some PaaS offers like [[Microsoft Azure]], [[Oracle Cloud#Platform as a Service (PaaS)|Oracle Cloud Platform]] and [[Google App Engine]], the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually. The latter has also been proposed by an architecture aiming to facilitate real-time in cloud environments.<ref>{{cite conference |author= Boniface, M. |title= Platform-as-a-Service Architecture for Real-Time Quality of Service Management in Clouds |conference= 5th International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services (ICIW) |year= 2010 |pages= 155–160 |place= Barcelona, Spain |publisher= IEEE |doi= 10.1109/ICIW.2010.91 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>{{qn|date=July 2015}}

Some integration and data management providers have also embraced specialized applications of PaaS as delivery models for data solutions. Examples include '''iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service)''' and '''dPaaS (Data Platform as a Service)'''. iPaaS enables customers to develop, execute and govern integration flows.<ref name="GartnerGlossary">{{cite web|last= Gartner|title= Gartner IT Glossary |url= http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/information-platform-as-a-service-ipaas|access-date= 6 July 2015}}</ref> Under the iPaaS integration model, customers drive the development and deployment of integrations without installing or managing any hardware or middleware.<ref name="GartnerReferenceModel">{{cite web|last= Gartner|title= Gartner Reference Model for Integration PaaS|url= http://www.gartner.com/id=1729256|accessdate= 16 January 2013|author2= Massimo Pezzini |author3= Paolo Malinverno |author4= Eric Thoo }}</ref> dPaaS delivers integration—and data-management—products as a fully managed service.<ref name="ITBusinessEdge">{{cite web|title= IT Business Edge |url= http://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/integration/liaisons-data-platform-as-a-service-includes-data-mapping.html|author= Loraine Lawson|accessdate= 6 July 2015}}</ref> Under the dPaaS model, the PaaS provider, not the customer, manages the development and execution of data solutions by building tailored data applications for the customer. dPaaS users retain transparency and control over data through [[data visualization|data-visualization]] tools.<ref name="EnterpriseCIOForum">{{cite web|last= Enterprise CIO Forum|title= The Value of Data Platform-as-a-Service (dPaaS)|url= http://www.enterprisecioforum.com/en/blogs/gabriellowy/value-data-platform-service-dpaas|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150419045605/http://www.enterprisecioforum.com/en/blogs/gabriellowy/value-data-platform-service-dpaas|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 19 April 2015|author2= Gabriel Lowy|accessdate= 6 July 2015}}</ref> Platform as a Service (PaaS) consumers do not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but have control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.

===Software as a service (SaaS)===
{{Main|Software as a service}}

The [[NIST]]'s definition of cloud computing defines Software as a Service as:<ref name="nist"/>

{{Quote|text=
The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.}}
In the software as a service (SaaS) model, users gain access to application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications. SaaS is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software" and is usually priced on a pay-per-use basis or using a subscription fee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of: SaaS|url= https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/56112/saas |work=PC Magazine Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> In the SaaS model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients. Cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs. This eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud user's own computers, which simplifies maintenance and support. Cloud applications differ from other applications in their scalability—which can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple [[virtual machines]] at run-time to meet changing work demand.<ref name="hamdaqa">{{cite book

This enables the business to reallocate IT operations costs away from hardware/software spending and from personnel expenses, towards meeting other goals. In addition, with applications hosted centrally, updates can be released without the need for users to install new software. One drawback of SaaS comes with storing the users' data on the cloud provider's server.

===Serverless computing===
{{Main|Serverless computing}}

Serverless computing is a cloud computing code [[execution (computing)|execution]] model in which the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping [[virtual machines]] as necessary to serve requests, and requests are billed by an abstract measure of the resources required to satisfy the request, rather than per virtual machine, per hour.<ref name='techcrunch-lambda'>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/24/aws-lamda-makes-serverless-applications-a-reality/|title=AWS Lambda Makes Serverless Applications A Reality|last=Miller|first=Ron|website=[[TechCrunch]]| date=24 Nov 2015|accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref> Despite the name, it does not actually involve running code without servers.<ref name='techcrunch-lambda'/> Serverless computing is so named because the business or person that owns the system does not have to purchase, rent or provision servers or virtual machines for the [[back-end database|back-end]] code to run on.

===Private cloud===
Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally.<ref name="nist" /> Undertaking a private cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources. It can improve business, but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities. Self-run [[data center]]s<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.govconnection.com/IPA/PM/Info/Cloud-Computing/Self-Run-Private-Cloud.htm |title=Self-Run Private Cloud Computing Solution&nbsp;– GovConnection |work=govconnection.com |year=2014 |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}</ref> are generally capital intensive. They have a significant physical footprint, requiring allocations of space, hardware, and environmental controls.

===Public cloud===
A cloud is called a "public cloud" when the services are rendered over a network that is open for public use. Public cloud services may be free.<ref>{{cite web|first=Margaret|last=Rouse|title=What is public cloud?|accessdate=12 October 2014|url=http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/public-cloud|publisher=Definition from Whatis.com}}</ref> Technically there may be little or no difference between public and private cloud architecture, however, security consideration may be substantially different for services (applications, storage, and other resources) that are made available by a service provider for a public audience and when communication is effected over a non-trusted network. Generally, public cloud service providers like [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS), [[Oracle Cloud|Oracle]], Microsoft and Google own and operate the infrastructure at their [[data center]] and access is generally via the Internet. AWS, Oracle, Microsoft, and Google also offer direct connect services called "AWS Direct Connect", "Oracle FastConnect", "Azure ExpressRoute", and "Cloud Interconnect" respectively, such connections require customers to purchase or lease a private connection to a peering point offered by the cloud provider.<ref name="idc"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/fastconnect|title=FastConnect {{!}} Oracle Cloud Infrastructure|website=cloud.oracle.com|access-date=2017-11-15}}</ref>

===Hybrid cloud===
'''Hybrid''' cloud is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community or public) that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models. Hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation, managed and/or dedicated services with cloud resources.<ref name="nist" /> [[Gartner]] defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private, public and community cloud services, from different service providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.gartner.com/thomas_bittman/2012/09/24/mind-the-gap-here-comes-hybrid-cloud/|title=Mind the Gap: Here Comes Hybrid Cloud – Thomas Bittman|work=Thomas Bittman|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref> A hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it can't be simply put in one category of private, public, or community cloud service. It allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service, by aggregation, integration or customization with another cloud service.

Varied use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist. For example, an organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud application, but interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/753708/Business_Intelligence_Takes_to_Cloud_for_Small_Businesses |title=Business Intelligence Takes to Cloud for Small Businesses |publisher=CIO.com |date=2014-06-04 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> This example of hybrid cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service through the addition of externally available public cloud services. Hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of factors such as data security and compliance requirements, level of control needed over data, and the applications an organization uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/cloud-services/hybrid-cloud-is-it-right-for-your-business--1261343|title=Hybrid cloud: is it right for your business?|author=Désiré Athow|work=TechRadar|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>

Another example of hybrid cloud is one where [[Information technology|IT]] organizations use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that can not be met by the private cloud.<ref>Metzler, Jim; Taylor, Steve. (2010-08-23) [http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/frame/2010/082310wan1.html "Cloud computing: Reality vs. fiction"], Network World.</ref> This capability enables hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds.<ref name="nist" /> Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or data center and "bursts" to a public cloud when the demand for computing capacity increases. A primary advantage of cloud bursting and a hybrid cloud model is that an organization pays for extra compute resources only when they are needed.<ref>Rouse, Margaret. [http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/cloud-bursting "Definition: Cloudbursting"], May 2011. SearchCloudComputing.com.</ref> Cloud bursting enables data centers to create an in-house IT infrastructure that supports average workloads, and use cloud resources from public or private clouds, during spikes in processing demands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://insights.dice.com/2012/06/21/how-cloudbursting-rightsizes-the-data-center/|title=How Cloudbursting "Rightsizes" the Data Center|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> The specialized model of hybrid cloud, which is built atop heterogeneous hardware, is called "Cross-platform Hybrid Cloud". A cross-platform hybrid cloud is usually powered by different CPU architectures, for example, x86-64 and ARM, underneath. Users can transparently deploy and scale applications without knowledge of the cloud's hardware diversity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@chanwit/cross-platform-hybrid-cloud-with-docker-ded000f792fb|title=Cross-Platform Hybrid Cloud with Docker|first=Chanwit|last=Kaewkasi|date=3 May 2015|publisher=}}</ref> This kind of cloud emerges from the rise of ARM-based system-on-chip for server-class computing.

===Others===

====Community cloud====
[[Community cloud]] shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a third-party, and either hosted internally or externally. The costs are spread over fewer users than a public cloud (but more than a private cloud), so only some of the cost savings potential of cloud computing are realized.<ref name="nist" />

====Distributed cloud====
A cloud computing platform can be assembled from a distributed set of machines in different locations, connected to a single network or hub service. It is possible to distinguish between two types of distributed clouds: public-resource computing and volunteer cloud.

* '''Public-resource computing'''—This type of distributed cloud results from an expansive definition of cloud computing, because they are more akin to distributed computing than cloud computing. Nonetheless, it is considered a sub-class of cloud computing. 
* '''Volunteer cloud'''—Volunteer cloud computing is characterized as the intersection of public-resource computing and cloud computing, where a cloud computing infrastructure is built using volunteered resources. Many challenges arise from this type of infrastructure, because of the volatility of the resources used to built it and the dynamic environment it operates in. It can also be called peer-to-peer clouds, or ad-hoc clouds. An interesting effort in such direction is Cloud@Home, it aims to implement a cloud computing infrastructure using volunteered resources providing a business-model to incentivize contributions through financial restitution.<ref>Vincenzo D. Cunsolo, Salvatore Distefano, Antonio Puliafito, Marco Scarpa: [http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/NCA.2009.41 Volunteer Computing and Desktop Cloud: The Cloud@Home Paradigm]. IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications, NCA 2009, pp&nbsp;134–139</ref>

====Multicloud====
{{Main|Multicloud}}

Multicloud is the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single heterogeneous architecture to reduce reliance on single vendors, increase flexibility through choice, mitigate against disasters, etc. It differs from hybrid cloud in that it refers to multiple cloud services, rather than multiple deployment modes (public, private, legacy).<ref name=rouse>{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Margaret|title=What is a multi-cloud strategy|url=http://searchcloudapplications.techtarget.com/definition/multi-cloud-strategy|publisher=SearchCloudApplications|accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=king>{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Rachel|title=Pivotal's head of products: We're moving to a multi-cloud world|url=http://www.zdnet.com/pivotals-head-of-products-were-moving-to-a-multi-cloud-world-7000030737/|publisher=ZDnet|accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.groovypost.com/reviews/multcloud-manage-multiple-cloud-accounts/ Multcloud manage multiple cloud accounts]. Retrieved on 06 August 2014</ref>

====Big Data cloud====
The issues of transferring large amounts of data to the cloud as well as data security once the data is in the cloud initially hampered adoption of cloud for [[big data]], but now that much data originates in the cloud and with the advent of [[bare-metal server]]s, the cloud has become<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dataconomy.com/2016/08/cloud-ready-for-big-data/ |title=Is the Cloud Finally Ready for Big Data? |last=Roh |first=Lucas |date=31 August 2016 |website=dataconomy.com |access-date=29 January 2018}}</ref> a solution for use cases including business [[analytics]] and [[geospatial analysis]].<ref name="YANG">{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Choawei|title=Big Data and cloud computing: innovation opportunities and challenges|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17538947.2016.1239771|journal=International Journal of Digital Earth|date=2016|issue=1|pages=13–53|doi=10.1080/17538947.2016.1239771}}</ref>

====HPC cloud====
HPC cloud refers to the use of cloud computing services and infrastructure to execute [[high-performance computing]] (HPC) applications.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Netto|first=M. |author2=Calheiros, R. |author3=Rodrigues, E. |author4=Cunha, R. |author5=Buyya, R. |title=HPC Cloud for Scientific and Business Applications: Taxonomy, Vision, and Research Challenges|journal=ACM Computing Surveys|volume=51|issue=1|pages=8:1–8:29|doi=10.1145/3150224|year=2018}}</ref> These applications consume considerable amount of computing power and memory and are traditionally executed on clusters of computers. Various vendors offer servers that can support the execution of these applications.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/| title = HPC in AWS| accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ibm.com/cloud/hpc| title = HPC in IBM Cloud|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/big-compute/| title = HPC in Microsoft Azure| accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://pod.penguincomputing.com/| title = Penguin Computing On Demand (POD) | accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref> In HPC cloud, the deployment model allows all HPC resources to be inside the cloud provider infrastructure or different portions of HPC resources to be shared between cloud provider and client on-premise infrastructure. The adoption of cloud to run HPC applications started mostly for applications composed of independent tasks with no inter-process communication. As cloud providers began to offer high-speed network technologies such as [[InfiniBand]], multiprocessing tightly coupled applications started to benefit from cloud as well.

[[File:CloudComputingSampleArchitecture.svg|thumb|325px|right|Cloud computing sample architecture]]

'''Cloud architecture''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=1632&categoryID=100 |title=Building GrepTheWeb in the Cloud, Part 1: Cloud Architectures |publisher=Developer.amazonwebservices.com |access-date=22 August 2010}}</ref> the [[systems architecture]] of the [[software systems]] involved in the delivery of cloud computing, typically involves multiple ''cloud components'' communicating with each other over a loose coupling mechanism such as a messaging queue. Elastic provision implies intelligence in the use of tight or loose coupling as applied to mechanisms such as these and others.

===Cloud engineering===
'''[[Cloud engineering]]''' is the application of [[engineering]] disciplines to cloud computing. It brings a systematic approach to the high-level concerns of commercialization, standardization, and governance in conceiving, developing, operating and maintaining cloud computing systems. It is a multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas such as [[systems engineering|systems]], [[software engineering|software]], [[web engineering|web]], [[performance engineering|performance]], [[information technology engineering]], [[security engineering|security]], [[platform engineering|platform]], [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk]], and [[Quality control|quality]] engineering.

==Security and privacy==
{{Main|Cloud computing issues}}

Cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time.  It could accidentally or deliberately alter or delete information.<ref name="ryan">{{cite web|url= http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/1/103200-cloud-computing-privacy-concerns-on-our-doorstep/fulltext |title= Cloud Computing Privacy Concerns on Our Doorstep }}</ref> Many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order without a warrant. That is permitted in their privacy policies, which users must agree to before they start using cloud services. Solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as end users' choices for how data is stored.<ref name="ryan"/> Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access.<ref name="cloudid">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2015.06.025|title = CloudID: Trustworthy cloud-based and cross-enterprise biometric identification| journal=Expert Systems with Applications| volume=42| issue=21| pages=7905–7916|year = 2015|last1 = Haghighat|first1 = Mohammad| last2=Zonouz| first2=Saman| last3=Abdel-Mottaleb| first3=Mohamed}}</ref><ref name="ryan"/>

According to the Cloud Security Alliance, the top three threats in the cloud are ''Insecure Interfaces and API's'', ''Data Loss & Leakage'', and ''Hardware Failure''—which accounted for 29%, 25% and 10% of all cloud security outages respectively. Together, these form shared technology vulnerabilities. In a cloud provider platform being shared by different users there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on same data server. Additionally, [[Eugene Schultz]], chief technology officer at Emagined Security, said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud. "There are some real Achilles' heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into". Because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers, hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack—a process he called "hyperjacking". Some examples of this include the Dropbox security breach, and iCloud 2014 leak.<ref name="psg.hitachi-solutions.com">{{Cite web|title = Google Drive, Dropbox, Box and iCloud Reach the Top 5 Cloud Storage Security Breaches List|url = https://psg.hitachi-solutions.com/credeon/blog/google-drive-dropbox-box-and-icloud-reach-the-top-5-cloud-storage-security-breaches-list|website = psg.hitachi-solutions.com|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}</ref> Dropbox had been breached in October 2014, having over 7 million of its users passwords stolen by hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by Bitcoins (BTC). By having these passwords, they are able to read private data as well as have this data be indexed by search engines (making the information public).<ref name="psg.hitachi-solutions.com"/>

There is the problem of legal ownership of the data (If a user stores some data in the cloud, can the cloud provider profit from it?). Many Terms of Service agreements are silent on the question of ownership.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/26/business/la-fi-tech-savvy-cloud-services-20120426 |title=Who owns your stuff in the cloud? |date=26 April 2012 |first=Michelle |last=Maltais |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref> Physical control of the computer equipment (private cloud) is more secure than having the equipment off site and under someone else's control (public cloud). This delivers great incentive to public cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/2244954/virtualization/security-of-virtualization--cloud-computing-divides-it-and-security-pros.html|title=Security of virtualization, cloud computing divides IT and security pros|last=|first=|date=2010-02-22|website=|publisher=Network World|accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> Some small businesses that don't have expertise in [[Information technology|IT]] security could find that it's more secure for them to use a public cloud. There is the risk that end users do not understand the issues involved when signing on to a cloud service (persons sometimes don't read the many pages of the terms of service agreement, and just click "Accept" without reading). This is important now that cloud computing is becoming popular and required for some services to work, for example for an [[intelligent personal assistant]] (Apple's [[Siri]] or [[Google Now]]). Fundamentally, private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the owner, however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money investment from the user.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Bumpy Road to Private Clouds| url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2549867/data-center/the-bumpy-road-to-private-clouds.html |access-date=8 October 2014| date=2010-12-20 }}</ref>

== Limitations and disadvantages ==
According to [[Bruce Schneier]], "The downside is that you will have limited customization options. Cloud computing is cheaper because of [[Economies of scale|economics of scale]], and — like any outsourced task — you tend to get what you get. A restaurant with a limited menu is cheaper than a personal chef who can cook anything you want. Fewer options at a much cheaper price: it's a feature, not a bug." He also suggests that "the cloud provider might not meet your legal needs" and that businesses need to weigh the benefits of cloud computing against the risks.<ref>{{Cite web

In cloud computing, the control of the back end infrastructure is limited to the cloud vendor only. Cloud providers often decide on the management policies, which moderates what the cloud users are able to do with their deployment.<ref>

}}</ref> This includes data caps, which are placed on cloud users by the cloud vendor allocating certain amount of bandwidth for each customer and are often shared among other cloud users.<ref name="The real limits of cloud computing"/>

Privacy and [[confidentiality]] are big concerns in some activities. For instance, sworn translators working under the stipulations of an [[non-disclosure agreement|NDA]], might face problems regarding [[sensitive data]] that are not [[encrypt]]ed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iapti.org/articles/art34-using-cloud-solutions-for-translation-yes-or-no.html |title=Cloud solutions for translation, yes or no?|access-date=23 February 2017|website=[[IAPTI]].org|last=Karra|first=Maria}}</ref>

Cloud computing is beneficial to many enterprises; it lowers costs and allows them to focus on competence instead of on matters of IT and infrastructure. Nevertheless, cloud computing has proven to have some limitations and disadvantages, especially for smaller business operations, particularly regarding security and downtime. Technical outages are inevitable and occur sometimes when cloud service providers (CSPs) become overwhelmed in the process of serving their clients. This may result to temporary business suspension. Since this technology's systems rely on the internet, an individual cannot be able to access their applications, server or data from the cloud during an outage.

==Emerging trends==
Cloud computing is still a subject of research.<ref name=ghc>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=David Mitchell|title=Hype Cycle for Cloud Computing, 2013|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2573318/hype-cycle-cloud-computing-|publisher=Gartner|accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref> A driving factor in the evolution of cloud computing has been [[chief technology officer]]s seeking to minimize risk of internal outages and mitigate the complexity of housing network and computing hardware in-house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hello-cirro.co.uk/evolution-of-cloud-computing/|title=The evolution of Cloud Computing|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref> Major cloud technology companies invest billions of dollars per year in cloud [[Research and Development]].

== Digital forensics in the cloud ==
The issue of carrying out investigations where the cloud storage devices cannot be physically accessed has generated a number of changes to the way that digital evidence is located and collected.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229021339_Cloud_forensics_An_overview|title=Cloud forensics: An overview|last=Ruan|first=Keyun|last2=Carthy|first2=Joe|last3=Kechadi|first3=Tahar|last4=Crosbie|first4=Mark|date=2011-01-01}}</ref> New process models have been developed to formalize collection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/19431/|title=The emergence of cloud storage and the need for a new digital forensic process model|last=R.|first=Adams,|date=2013|website=researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au|access-date=2018-03-18}}</ref>

In some scenarios existing digital forensics tools can be employed to access cloud storage as networked drives (although this is a slow process generating a large amount of internet traffic).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

An alternative approach is to deploy a tool that processes in the cloud itself <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Richard|first=Adams,|last2=Graham|first2=Mann,|last3=Valerie|first3=Hobbs,|date=2017|title=ISEEK, a tool for high speed, concurrent, distributed forensic data acquisition|url=http://ro.ecu.edu.au/adf/171/|journal=Research Online|doi=10.4225/75/5a838d3b1d27f}}</ref>

For organizations using Office 365 with an 'E5' subscription there is the option to use Microsoft's built-in ediscovery resources, although these do not provide all the functionality that is typically required for a forensic process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/office-365-advanced-ediscovery-fd53438a-a760-45f6-9df4-861b50161ae4|title=Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery|access-date=2018-03-18}}</ref>
