[[Laws regarding child pornography]] generally include sexual images involving prepubescents, pubescent or post-pubescent minors and computer-generated images that appear to involve them.<ref name=doj1/> Most possessors of child pornography who are arrested are found to possess images of prepubescent children; possessors of pornographic images of post-pubescent minors are less likely to be prosecuted, even though those images also fall within the statutes.<ref name=doj1/>

Producers of child pornography try to avoid prosecution by distributing their material across national borders, though this issue is increasingly being addressed with regular arrests of suspects from a number of countries occurring over the last few years.<ref name=doj1/><ref name=ncmec/> The prepubescent pornography is viewed and collected by [[pedophilia|pedophiles]] for a variety of purposes, ranging from private sexual uses, trading with other pedophiles, preparing children for sexual abuse as part of the process known as "[[child grooming]]", or enticement leading to entrapment for sexual exploitation such as production of new child pornography or [[child prostitution]].<ref name=CrossonTower208>{{cite book|title=Understanding child abuse and neglect  |first=Cynthia |last=Crosson-Tower |isbn=0-205-40183-X |publisher=Allyn & Bacon |year=2005|page=208}}</ref><ref name=Wortley14>{{cite journal|title=Child Pornography on the Internet |author1=Richard Wortley |author2=Stephen Smallbone |journal=Problem-Oriented Guides for Police |volume=No. 41|pages=14–16}}</ref><ref name= Levesque64>{{cite book |title=Sexual Abuse of Children: A Human Rights Perspective |first=Roger J.

The United Kingdom children's charity [[Action for Children|NCH]] has stated that demand for child pornography on the Internet has led to an increase in sex abuse cases, due to an increase in the number of children abused in the production process.<ref name="gu20040112">{{cite news | title = Internet porn 'increasing child abuse' | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/jan/12/childprotection.childrensservices | work = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited |date=12 January 2004 | accessdate = 1 June 2007 | location=London}}</ref>
In a study analyzing men arrested for child pornography possession in the United States over a one-year period from 2000 to 2001, 83% had pornographic images of prepubescent children and 80% had images graphically depicting sexual penetration. 21% had images depicting violence such as bondage, rape, or torture and most of those involved images of children who were gagged, bound, blindfolded, or otherwise enduring sadistic sex. 39% had child-pornography videos with motion and sound. 79% also had images of nude or semi-nude children, but only 1% possessed such images alone. Law enforcement found that 48% had more than 100 graphic still images, and 14% had 1,000 or more graphic images. 40% were "dual offenders," who sexually victimized children and possessed child pornography.<ref name="missingkids"/>

A 2007 study in Ireland, undertaken by the [[Garda Síochána]], revealed the most serious content in a sample of over 100 cases involving indecent images of children. In 44% of cases, the most serious images depicted nudity or erotic posing, in 7% they depicted sexual activity between children, in 7% they depicted non-penetrative sexual activity between adults and children, in 37% they depicted penetrative sexual activity between adults and children, and in 5% they depicted sadism or bestiality.<ref name= O/>

According to one paper from the [[Mayo Clinic]] of the U.S.A. based on case reports of those under treatment, 30% to 80% of individuals who viewed child pornography and 76% of individuals who were arrested for Internet child pornography had molested a child. As the total number of those who view such images can not be ascertained, the ratio of passive viewing to molestation remains unknown.

{{further|COPINE scale}}
In the late 1990s, the COPINE project ("Combating Paedophile Information Networks in Europe") at [[University College Cork]], in cooperation with the [[Paedophile Unit]] of the [[London Metropolitan Police]], developed a typology to categorize child abuse images for use in both research and law enforcement.<ref name=copine/> The ten-level typology was based on analysis of images available on websites and internet newsgroups.
Other researchers have adopted similar ten-level scales.<ref name=taylor2001>{{cite journal|last=Taylor |first=M. |author2=Quayle, E.|author3=Holland, G. |year=2001 |title=Child Pornography, the Internet and Offending |publisher=ISUMA |journal=The Canadian Journal of Policy Research |volume= 2 (2): 94–100}}</ref>  In 2002 in the UK, the Sentencing Advisory Panel adapted the COPINE scale to five levels and recommended its adoption for sentencing guidelines, omitting levels 1 to 3 and recommending that levels 4 to 6 combine as  sentencing level 1 and that the four levels from 7 to 10 each form an individual severity level, for a total of 5 sentencing stages.<ref name=copine/>

Digital cameras and Internet distribution facilitated by the use of credit cards and the ease of transferring images across national borders has made it easier than ever before for users of child pornography to obtain the photographs and videos.<ref name=doj1/><ref name=ncmec/> The NCMEC estimated in 2003 that 20% of all pornography traded over the Internet was child pornography, and that since 1997 the number of child pornography images available on the Internet had increased by 1500%.<ref name=ncmec>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncmec.org/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&PageId=2064 |title=Child porn among fastest growing internet businesses |date=5 August 2005 |accessdate=13 March 2008 |publisher=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018231331/http://www.ncmec.org/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&PageId=2064 |archivedate=18 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2007, the British-based [[Internet Watch Foundation]] reported that child pornography on the Internet is becoming more brutal and graphic, and the number of images depicting violent abuse has risen fourfold since 2003.<ref name=IWF/> The CEO stated "The worrying issue is the severity and the gravity of the images is increasing. We're talking about prepubescent children being raped." About 80 percent of the children in the abusive images are female, and 91 percent appear to be children under the age of 12. Prosecution is difficult because multiple international servers are used, sometimes to transmit the images in fragments to evade the law.<ref name=IWF>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/04/16/international/i170148D42.DTL |title=IWF |accessdate=30 April 2008 |agency=Associated Press |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202021456/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2007%2F04%2F16%2Finternational%2Fi170148D42.DTL |archivedate=2 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Some child pornographers also circumvent detection by using [[Computer virus|virus]]es to illegally gain control of computers on which they remotely store child pornography.

Regarding internet proliferation, the U.S. Department of Justice states that "At any one time there are estimated to be more than one million pornographic images of children on the Internet, with 200 new images posted daily." They also note that a single offender arrested in the U.K. possessed 450,000 child pornography images, and that a single child pornography site received a million hits in a month. Further, that much of the trade in child pornography takes place at hidden levels of the Internet, and that it has been estimated that there are between 50,000 and 100,000 paedophiles involved in organised pornography rings around the world, and that one third of these operate from the United States.

One massive international child pornography ring was centered in the Netherlands.  In the largest ever operation of its kind, police in 30 countries arrested 184 suspects and identified 486 others. Dutch authorities arrested 37-year-old Israeli-born Dutch citizen Amir Ish-Hurwitz, founder and owner of the internet forum Boylover.net, the center of the ring. At its peak, the forum had more than 70,000 members around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.org/archive/massive-dutch-run-child-pornography-ring-revealed|title=Massive Dutch-run child pornography ring revealed|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/world/europe/18iht-child18.html|title=More Arrests Likely in Pedophile Raid|date=18 March 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=29 September 2016}}</ref>

For a brief time between April 2016 to September 2017 a [[dark web]] site known as "[[Childs Play (website)|Childs Play]]" was active. Investigators later discovered that the site was run by a group of Australian police.

In 2008, the [[Google search]] [[Web search engine|engine]] adapted a [[software]] program in order to faster track child pornography accessible through their site.

===Collector behavior and motives===
Viewers of child pornography who are pedophiles are particularly obsessive about collecting, organizing, categorizing, and labeling their child pornography collection according to age, gender, sex act and fantasy.<ref name=CrossonTower200>{{cite book|title=Understanding child abuse and neglect |first=Cynthia |last=Crosson-Tower |isbn=0-205-40183-X |publisher=Allyn & Bacon |year=2005|pages=198–200}}</ref><ref name= Lanning/> According to FBI agent Ken Lanning,  "collecting" pornography does not mean that they merely view pornography, but that they save it, and "it comes to define, fuel, and validate their most cherished sexual fantasies." An extensive collection indicates a strong sexual preference for children, and if a collector of child pornography is also a pedophile, the owned collection is the single best indicator of what he or she wants to do.<ref name= Lanning>{{cite journal|title=Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis 4th ed|first=Kenneth V. |last=Lanning |year=2001 |publisher=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children|volume=86}}</ref>  The [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] describes researchers Taylor and Quayle's analysis of pedophile pornography collecting:

{{bq|1=The obsessive nature of the collecting and the narrative or thematic links for collections, led to the building of social communities on the internet dedicated to extending these collections. Through these "virtual communities" collectors are able to downgrade the content and abusive nature of the collections, see the children involved as objects rather than people, and their own behaviour as normal: It is an expression of 'love' for children rather than abuse.<ref name=NSPCC>{{cite web|title=Child pornography: images of the abuse of children|year=2003|url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/research/Briefings/imagesofchildabuse_wda48219.html|publisher=National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|access-date=8 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080425024551/http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/research/Briefings/imagesofchildabuse_wda48219.html#|archive-date=25 April 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}

These offenders are likely to employ elaborate security measures to avoid detection.<ref name=CrossonTower200/> The US DOJ notes that "there is a core of veteran offenders, some of whom have been active in pedophile newsgroups for more than 20 years, who possess high levels of technological expertise," also noting that pedophile bulletin boards often contain technical advice from child pornography users' old hands to newcomers."<ref name= Lanning/>

A 1986 U.S. Senate report found that motives for people's collecting child pornography include arousal and gratification; validation and justification of pedophile behaviour; to show the images to children to lower their inhibitions to engage in sex; preservation of an image of a child at the age of sexual preference; blackmail of depicted individuals; a medium of exchange and communication with other child pornography consumers; and profit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Child pornography: an international perspective|author=Healy, Margaret A.|publisher=U.S. Embassy Stockholm|url=http://www.crime-research.org/articles/536/3|date=2 August 2004}}</ref> A 2012 [[U.S. Sentencing Commission]] report found that child pornography offenders, while "much more likely to be sexually aroused by children than contact sex offenders or the general population", can also have non-sexual motives for collecting child pornography, including initial curiosity, compulsive collecting behaviors, avoidance of stress and dissatisfaction with life, and an ability to create a new and more socially successful identity (within an online community). Some offenders find collecting child pornography enjoyable regardless of whether the images are sexually exciting to them; their interest is in assembling complete sets and organizing the material as a pastime, analogously to what a [[stamp collecting|stamp collector]] might do.<ref>{{cite book|title=Report to the Congress: Federal Child Pornography Offenses|chapter=Child Pornography Offender Behavior|author=U.S. Sentencing Commission|date=2012|url=http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/news/congressional-testimony-and-reports/sex-offense-topics/201212-federal-child-pornography-offenses/Chapter_04.pdf}}</ref>

The assistant secretary for [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] added that the case reflected three larger trends that are becoming more common in child pornography rings. One is the increasing prevalence of "home-grown" pornographic images that are produced by predators themselves, and include live [[streaming video]] images of children being abused, not just the circulation of repeated images. Another trend is the growing use of sophisticated security measures and of [[peer-to-peer networking]], in which participants can share files with one another on their computers rather than downloading them from a web site. The group used [[encryption]] and data destruction software to protect the files and screening measures to ensure only authorized participants could enter the chat room. A third trend is the increasingly violent and graphic nature of the images involving the abuse of younger children.<ref name=Chicago>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/national/16porn.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=child+pornography+ring&st=nyt&oref=slogin

According to [[Jim Gamble]], CEO of the [[Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre]], around 50 per cent of sites showing children being abused are operated on a pay-per-view basis. "The people involved in these sites often aren't doing it because they're deviant by nature. They're doing it because they're business people. It's risk versus profits. We need to reduce the profit motivation." The CEOPP was established in 2006, and targets the finances of organised criminal gangs selling images of child abuse.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/nov/13/childprotection.ukcrime|title=Task force to seize child porn profits|accessdate=3 May 2008 |work=guardian.co.uk | location=London | first=Jamie | last=Doward | date=13 November 2005}}</ref>

== Laws ==

===History===
In the United States, the first federal law to ban the for-profit production and distribution of child pornography was the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977. In response to ''[[New York v. Ferber]]'', {{ussc|458|747|1982}}, a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing the prohibition of child pornography even if it did not meet the obscenity standard established in ''[[Miller v. California]]'', Congress passed the Child Protection Act of 1984, broadening the definition of child pornography and criminalizing nonprofit child pornography trafficking. The 1986 [[Meese Report]] found that child pornography was a cause of serious harm; this led to the passage of the Child Sexual Abuse and Pornography Act of 1986, which increased penalties for repeat offenders.<ref>{{cite book|title=The History of the Child Pornography Guidelines|date=October 2009|author=U.S. Sentencing Commission|chapter=Child Pornography Statutes in the Pre-Guidelines Era|url=http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-projects-and-surveys/sex-offenses/20091030_History_Child_Pornography_Guidelines.pdf}}</ref>

The U.S. Supreme Court decision ''[[Osborne v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|495|103|1990}}, ruled that the U.S. Constitution allowed prohibition of child pornography possession. The Court noted that at the time of the decision, 19 U.S. states had laws on their books prohibiting child pornography possession. As of 2015, all 50 U.S. states had such laws. Provisions of the [[Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996]] that banned [[virtual child pornography]] were struck down in ''[[Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition]]'', {{ussc|535|234|2002}}. Congress passed several laws increasing the penalties for child pornography offenses, so that from 1997 to 2007, the mean sentence of child pornography offenders increased from 20.59 months to 91.30 months of confinement, an increase of 443%.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lessons From Two Failures: Sentencing for Cocaine and Child Pornography Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in the United States|author=Steiker, Carol S.|volume=76|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|pages=27–52|date=2013|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol76/iss1/3}}</ref> In 2003, Congress passed the [[PROTECT Act]], authorizing lifetime terms of [[federal supervised release]] for child pornography offenders;<ref>{{uscsub|18|3583|k}}</ref> since U.S. Sentencing Guidelines recommend imposing the maximum term of supervised release for all sex offenders,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2014/2014-chapter-5#5d12|title=2014 Guidelines Manual, §5D1.2.

[[File:Federal prosecutions of child sex exploitation offenders.png|right|frameless|300px]] During 2006, 3,661 suspects were referred to U.S. attorneys for child sex exploitation offenses. Child pornography constituted 69% of referrals, followed by sex abuse (16%) and sex transportation (14%). In 2006, the median prison sentence imposed was greatest for sex abuse offenses (70 months) followed by child pornography (63 months) and sex transportation (60 months). The median sentenced for sex transportation was 60 months in 2006 and 1996. The median sentence increased from 44 to 70 months for sex abuse and from 15 to 63 months for child pornography. In comparison, median prison terms for drug and weapon offenders remained stable and increased for violent offenses.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fpcseo06.pdf|title = Federal Prosecution of Child Sex Exploitation Offenders, 2006|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}</ref>

A bill named [[Internet Safety Act]], intended to stop child pornography and protect children from [[online predator]]s by requiring [[Internet service provider]]s to keep track of data pertaining to users that were assigned a [[Dynamic IP address|temporarily assigned network address]], was introduced in 2009 but was finally not enacted.

In fiscal year 2010, the average term of supervised release for non-production offenders was approximately 20 years; the average term of supervised release for offenders sentenced under the production guideline was nearly 27 years.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/news/congressional-testimony-and-reports/sex-offense-topics/201212-federal-child-pornography-offenses/Chapter_12.pdf|chapter=Findings, Conclusions, and Recommendations to Congress|title=Report to the Congress: Federal Child Pornography Offenses|date=2012|author=U.S. Sentencing Commission}}</ref>

In Europe the [[CIRCAMP]] Law Enforcement project is aimed at reducing the availability of abusive material on the Web, combining traditional police investigative methods and Police/Internet industry cooperation by blocking access to domains containing such files. The result is country specific lists according to national legislation in the participating countries. This police initiative has a worldwide scope in its work but is partly financed by the [[European Commission]].

When child pornography is distributed across international borders, customs agencies also participate in investigations and enforcement, such as in the 2001–2002 cooperative effort between the United States [[Customs Service]] and local operational law enforcement agencies in Russia. A search warrant issued in the USA by the Customs Service resulted in seizing of computers and email records by the Russian authorities, and arrests of the pornographers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Transnational crime: The case of Russian organised crime and the role of international cooperation in law enforcement |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3996/is_200201/ai_n9061972/print |publisher=[[Heldref Publications]] |date=Winter 2002 |last=Shelley |first=Louise |accessdate=14 December 2008 |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |issn=1074-6846 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006074631/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3996/is_200201/ai_n9061972/print |archivedate=6 October 2008 |df= }}</ref>

===National and international law===
{{Main|Laws regarding child pornography}}

Child pornography laws provide severe penalties for producers and distributors in almost all societies, usually including incarceration, with shorter duration of sentences for non-commercial distribution depending on the extent and content of the material distributed. Convictions for possessing child pornography also usually include prison sentences, but those sentences are often converted to probation for first-time offenders.<ref name= Akdeniz11/>

In 2006, the [[International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children]] (ICMEC)  published a report of findings on the presence of child pornography legislation in the then-184 [[INTERPOL]] member countries.  It later updated this information, in subsequent editions, to include 196 UN member countries.<ref name="icmec.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_X1&PageId=4346 |title=Child Pornography: Model Legislation & Global Review |publisher=ICMEC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415101647/http://www.icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_X1&PageId=4346 |archivedate=15 April 2015 |df= }}</ref><ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VPhAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Litigating Transnational Human Rights Obligations: Alternative Judgments|publisher=Routledge |author1=Mark Gibney |author2=Wouter Vandenhole |page=63 |year=2013|isbn=1135121052}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C_AF0rzXS9AC&pg=PA20|title=Parents Guide to the Internet|author=Jay LaBonte|publisher=Lulu|pages=20–21|year= 2007|isbn=1430307692}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kI51wV4ticIC&pg=PA136|title=Handbook of Digital and Multimedia Forensic Evidence|author=John J.

ICMEC stated that it found in its initial report that only 27 countries had legislation needed to deal with child pornography offenses, while 95 countries did not have any legislation that specifically addressed child pornography, making child pornography a global issue worsened by the inadequacies of domestic legislation.<ref>[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/cyb/cybersecurity/cop/icmec-model-legislation-update-april-2010.pdf "Model Legislation Update: Since the Beginning"], ICMEC.

==Sexting and filming among minors==
{{main|Sexting}}
Sexting is sending, receiving, or forwarding sexually explicit messages, photographs, or images, primarily between mobile phones, of oneself to others (such as dating partners or friends). It may also include the use of a computer or any digital device.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Salter|first=Michael|year=2013|title=Beyond Criminalisation and Responsibilitisim Sexting, Gender and Young People|url=|journal=Sydney Law School|volume=24|pages=310–315|via=}}</ref> Such images may be passed along to others or posted on the Internet. In many jurisdictions, the [[age of consent]] is lower than the [[age of majority]], and a [[Minor (law)|minor]] who is over the age of consent can legally have sex with a person of the same age. Many laws on child pornography were passed before [[camera phone|cell phone cameras]] became common among teenagers over the age of consent and sexting was understood as a phenomenon. Teenagers who are legally able to consent to sex, but under the age of majority, can be charged with production and distribution of child pornography if they send naked images of themselves to friends or sex partners of the same age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/technology&id=6555650 |title=Sexting teens can go too far - 12/14/08 - Philadelphia News - 6abc.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=14 December 2008 |accessdate=16 October 2009}}</ref><ref name="Wolak">{{cite web|last1=Wolak|first1=Janis|last2=Finkelhor|first2=David|last3=Mitchel|first3=Kimberly J.|title=Trends in Arrests for Child Pornography Production: The Third National Juvenile Online Victimization Study (NJOV‐3)|url=http://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1046&context=ccrc|accessdate=31 August 2016}}</ref>  The University of New Hampshire’s Crimes Against Children Research Center estimates that 7 percent of people arrested on suspicion of child pornography production in 2009 were teenagers who shared images with peers consensually.<ref name="Wolak"/> Such arrests also include teenage couples or friends with a small [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|age disparity]], where one is a legal adult and the other is not.<ref name="Feyerick">{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/04/07/sexting.busts/|title='Sexting' lands teen on sex offender list - CNN.com|first=By Deborah Feyerick and Sheila Steffen CNN's American|last=Morning|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}</ref><ref name="Brady">{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/sexting-youths-placed-on-sex-offenders-register-20110723-1hugu.html|title='Sexting' youths placed on sex offenders register|first=Nicole|last=Brady|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}</ref> In some countries, [[mandatory sentencing]] requires anybody convicted of such an offense to be placed on a [[sex offender registry]].<ref name="Feyerick"/><ref name="Brady"/> The vast majority of underage sexual images are produced by adults, however, and adults often solicit underage teenagers to share the images.<ref name="Wolak"/>

Legal professionals and academics have criticized the use of child pornography laws with mandatory punishments against teenagers over the age of consent for sex offenses. Florida cyber crimes defense attorney David S. Seltzer wrote of this that "I do not believe that our child pornography laws were designed for these situations&nbsp;... A conviction for possession of child pornography in Florida draws up to five years in prison for each picture or video, plus a lifelong requirement to register as a sex offender."<ref>[http://www.cybercrimelawyerblog.com/2008/12/miami_criminal_defense_lawyer_1.html Cyber Crime Lawyer Blog: Miami Criminal Defense Lawyer], December 2008</ref>

In a 2013 interview, assistant professor of communications at the [[University of Colorado Denver]], Amy Adele Hasinoff, who studies the repercussions of sexting has stated that the "very harsh" child pornography laws are "designed to address adults exploiting children" and should not replace better sex education and consent training for teens. She went on to say, "Sexting is a sex act, and if it's consensual, that's fine [...] Anyone who distributes these pictures without consent is doing something malicious and abusive, but child pornography laws are too harsh to address it."<ref name=2013CaNPSelfiePorn>{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Karen|title=Child pornography laws ‘too harsh’ to deal with minors sexting photos without consent, experts say|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/11/16/child-pornography-laws-too-harsh-to-deal-with-minors-sexting-photos-without-consent-experts-say/|publisher=National Post News – Canada|accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref>

In April 2018, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that of the sexually explicit images of children and teenagers (11 to 15 year-olds) found on the Internet, 31% were made by children or teenagers from November 2017 to February 2018, with 40% in December 2017; 349 cases in January 2017 and 1717 in January 2018. The images were made by children or teenagers photographing or filming each other or as [[selfie]]s, without adults present or coercing, by unwittingly imitating adult pornographic or nude images or videos (including of celebrities) that they had found on the Internet. The report said that pedophiles trawled for and amassed such images.<ref name="Rudgard">{{cite web |last= Rudgard |first= Olivia |title= Children's own 'sex selfies' fuelling rise in child abuse images |publisher= ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |accessdate= April 21, 2018 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/18/childrens-sex-selfies-fuelling-rise-child-abuse-images/}}</ref><ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Wednesday 18 April 2018, page 1 (bottom right corner) and page 2.</ref>
