There has been controversy about the practicality of establishing a right to be forgotten to the status of an international [[human rights|human right]] in respect to access to information, due in part to the vagueness of current rulings attempting to implement such a right.<ref name="fleischer">{{cite web|first=Peter |last=Fleischer |url=http://peterfleischer.blogspot.co.nz/2011/03/foggy-thinking-about-right-to-oblivion.html |title=Peter Fleischer: Privacy...?: Foggy thinking about the Right to Oblivion |publisher=Peterfleischer.blogspot.co.nz |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref> Furthermore, there are concerns about its impact on the right to [[freedom of expression]], its interaction with the [[right to privacy]], and whether creating a right to be forgotten would decrease the quality of the [[Internet]] through [[censorship]] and a [[historical revisionism (negationism)|rewriting of history]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Tessa |last=Mayes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2011/mar/18/forgotten-online-european-union-law-internet |title=We have no right to be forgotten online |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-05-21 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref> Those in favour of the right to be forgotten cite its necessity due to issues such as [[revenge porn]] sites appearing in [[search engine]] listings for a person's name, as well as instances of these results referencing petty crimes individuals may have committed many years ago. The central concern here being, these results can unduly play a prominent role in a person's online presence almost indefinitely if not removed.<ref name=Arthur/>

==Conception and proposal==
Europe's data protection legislation are intended to secure potentially damaging, private information about individuals. The notion of "the right to be forgotten" is derived from numerous preexisting European ideas. There is a longstanding belief in the United Kingdom, specifically under the [[Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974|Rehabilitation of Offenders Act]], that after a certain period of time, many criminal convictions are "spent", meaning that information regarding said person should not be regarded when obtaining insurance or seeking employment. Similarly, France values this right - le droit à l'oubli (the right to be forgotten).<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/14/explainer-right-to-be-forgotten-the-newest-cultural-shibboleth|title=Explaining the 'right to be forgotten' – the newest cultural shibboleth|author=Charles Arthur|work=the Guardian}}</ref> It was officially recognized in French Law in 2010.<ref>{{Citation |year=2010 |title=Charte sur la publicité ciblée et la protection des internautes |trans-title=Code of Good Practice on Targeted Advertising and the Protection of Internet Users |publisher=Secrétariat d'Etat chargé de la Prospective et du Développement de l'économie numérique |url=http://www.huntonfiles.com/files/webupload/PrivacyLaw_Charte_publicite.pdf |format=PDF |language=FR}}</ref> Views on the right to be forgotten differ greatly between America and EU countries. In America, transparency, the right of free speech according to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and the right to know have typically been favored over the obliteration of truthfully published information regarding individuals and corporations. The term "right to be forgotten" is a relatively new idea, though on May 13, 2014, the European Court of Justice legally solidified that the "right to be forgotten" is a human right when they ruled against Google in the ''[[Google v González|Costeja]]'' case.

In 1995, the [[European Union]] adopted the [[Data Protection Directive|European Data Protection Directive]] (Directive 95/46/EC) to regulate the processing of personal data.<ref>Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. EU Directive 1995.</ref> This is now considered a component of [[human rights law]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mitrou |first=Lilian |first2=Maria |last2=Karyda |title=EU's Data Protection Reform and the right to be forgotten—A legal response to a technological challenge? |work=5th International Conference of Information Law and Ethics |year=2012 |pages=29–30 |ssrn=2165245 }}</ref> The new European Proposal for [[General Data Protection Regulation]] provides protection and exemption for companies listed as "media" companies, like newspapers and other journalistic work. However, Google purposely opted out of being classified as a "media" company and so is not protected. Judges in the European Union ruled that because the international corporation, Google, is a collector and processor of data it should be classified as a "data controller" under the meaning of the EU data protection directive. These "data controllers" are required under EU law to remove data that is "inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant", making this directive of global importance.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

==Current legal frameworks==
The right to be forgotten "reflects the claim of an individual to have certain data deleted so that third persons can no longer trace them."<ref name="weber">Weber, Rolf H. "The right to be forgotten." More than a Pandora's Box 2 (2011)</ref>{{rp|121}} It has been defined as "the right to silence on past events in life that are no longer occurring."<ref>Pino, G. (2000). "The right to personal identity in Italian private law: Constitutional interpretation and judge-made rights". In: M. Van Hoecke; F. Ost (eds.). The harmonization of private law in Europe (pp. 225-237). Oxford: Hart Publishing. p. 237.</ref> The right to be forgotten leads to allowing individuals to have information, videos or photographs about themselves deleted from certain internet records so that they cannot be found by search engines.<ref name="weber"/>
{{As of|2011}} there are few protections against the harm that incidents such as [[revenge porn]] sharing, or pictures uploaded due to poor judgement, can do.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hill |first=Kashmir |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/07/06/revenge-porn-with-a-facebook-twist |title=Revenge Porn With A Facebook Twist |publisher=Forbes |date=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref>

The right to be forgotten is distinct from the [[right to privacy]], due to the distinction that the right to privacy constitutes information that is not publicly known, whereas the right to be forgotten involves removing information that was publicly known at a certain time and not allowing third parties to access the information.<ref name="weber"/>{{rp|122}}<ref>{{cite web|first=L.

Limitations of application in a [[jurisdiction]] include the inability to require removal of information held by companies outside the jurisdiction. There is no global framework to allow individuals control over their online image. However, Professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, an expert from Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, said that Google can not escape compliance with the law of France implementing the decision of the European Court of Justice in 2014 on the right to be forgotten. Mayer-Schönberger said nations, including the US, had long maintained that their local laws have "extra-territorial effects".<ref>(September 23, 2015)[http://en.yibada.com/articles/66331/20150922/expert-google-escape-french-law-right-forgotten.htm?exe=reporter Expert: Google Can Not Escape French Law on Right to Delist].

===European Union===
In Article 12 of the Directive 95/46/EC the EU gave a legal base to internet protection for individuals.<ref name="mantelero"/>{{rp|233}} In 2012 the [[European Commission]] disclosed a draft European Data Protection Regulation to supersede the directive, which includes specific protection in the right to be forgotten in Article 17.<ref>European Commission.

Article 17. Right to be forgotten and To Erasure</ref>

To exercise the right to be forgotten and request removal from a search engine, one must complete a form through the search engine's website. [[Google]]'s removal request process requires the applicant to identify their country of residence, personal information, a list of the URLs to be removed along with a short description of each one, and attachment of legal identification.<ref>https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_eudpa?product=websearch</ref> The applicant receives an email from Google confirming the request but the request must be assessed before it is approved for removal. If the request is approved, searches using the individual's name will no longer result in the content appearing in search results. The content remains online and is not erased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-right-to-be-forgotten-form-192837|title=How Google's New "Right To Be Forgotten" Form Works: An Explainer|date=30 May 2014|work=Search Engine Land}}</ref> After a request is filled, their removals team reviews the request, weighing "the individual's right to privacy against the public's right to know", deciding if the website is "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes for which they were processed".<ref name=Brindle>{{cite web|last1=Brindle|first1=Beth|title=How can Google forget you?|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/how-can-google-forget-you.htm|website=How Stuff Works|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref>  Google has formed an Advisory Council of various professors, lawyers, and government officials from around Europe to provide guidelines for these decisions.<ref name="Powles and Chaparro">{{cite news|last1=Powles|first1=Julia|last2=Chaparro|first2=Enrique|title=How Google determined our right to be forgotten|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/18/the-right-be-forgotten-google-search|accessdate=22 May 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> However, the review process is still a mystery to the general public. Guidelines set by EU regulators were not released until November 2014, but Google began to take action on this much sooner than that, which (according to one author) allowed them "to shape interpretation to [their] own ends".<ref name="Powles and Chaparro" /> In May 2015, eighty academics called for more transparency from Google, in an open letter.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/14/dear-google-open-letter-from-80-academics-on-right-to-be-forgotten|title = Dear Google: open letter from 80 academics on 'right to be forgotten'|website = The Guardian|last = Kiss|first = Jemima}}</ref>

The form asks people to select one of the twenty-eight countries that make up the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|title=Search Removal Request Under Data Protection Law in Europe|url=https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_eudpa?product=websearch|website=Google|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> "The form allows an individual or someone representing an individual to put in a request" for the removal of any URLs believed to be a violation of the individual's privacy.<ref name= "Sullivan D">{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Danny|title=How Google's New 'Right to be Forgotten' Form Works: An Explainer|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-right-to-be-forgotten-form-192837|accessdate=22 May 2015|publisher=Search Engine Land|date=30 May 2014}}</ref> Regardless of who is submitting the form, some form of photo identification of the person the form is being submitted for must be presented. The purpose of this is to provide proof that the person for whom the request is being made does in fact approve.
 
The form allows people to submit the name they would like search results removed for. However, it only allows for the submission of one name, which some view as one of its flaws.<ref name= "Sullivan D" /> For example, if someone known as both "Lawrence Smith" and "Larry Smith" were to submit a form for the removal of search results for his name, he would only be allowed to indicate one of these names on the form.<ref name= "Sullivan D" /> Many people view it as inconvenient and believe it is a problem that Google should be able to easily fix.<ref name= "Sullivan D" />

In July 2014, in the early stages of Google's effort to comply with the court ruling, legal experts questioned whether Google's widely publicised delistings of a number of news articles violated the UK and EU [[Data Protection Directive]], since in implementing the Directive, Google is required to weigh the damage to the person making the request against any public interest in the information being available.<ref name="whydoit">{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/07/04/google_peston_bbc_delisting_not_compliant_w_public_interest_law_says_expert/ |title=Google de-listing of BBC article 'broke UK and Euro public interest laws' - So WHY do it? |last1=Orlowski |first1=Andrew |date=4 July 2014 |website=www.theregister.co.uk |publisher=The Register |accessdate=4 July 2014}}</ref> Google indeed acknowledged that some of its search result removals, affecting articles that were of public interest, were incorrect, and reinstated the links a week later.<ref name="Arthur">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/04/what-is-google-deleting-under-the-right-to-be-forgotten-and-why|last=Arthur|first=Charles|title=What is Google deleting under the 'right to be forgotten' - and why?

Google notifies websites that have URLs delinked, and the BBC and other news organizations have published lists of delinked articles. Complainants have been named in news commentary regarding those delinkings. In August 2015 the British Data Protection Agency issued an enforcement action requiring Google to delink some of these more recent articles from searches for a complainant's name, after Google refused to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/20/google-ordered-to-remove-links-to-stories-about-right-to-be-forgotten-removals|title = Google ordered to remove links to 'right to be forgotten' removal stories|website = The Guardian|last = Gibbs|first = Samuel}}</ref> Google complied with the request.<ref name=":0" /> Some academics have criticized news organizations and Google for their behavior.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/01/bbc-wrong-right-to-be-forgotten|title = Why the BBC is wrong to republish 'right to be forgotten' links|website = The Guardian|last = Powles|first = Julia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://theconversation.com/privacy-watchdog-takes-first-step-against-those-undermining-right-to-be-forgotten-46495|title = Privacy watchdog takes first step against those undermining right to be forgotten|website = The Conversation|last = Boiten|first = Eerke}}</ref>

[[YouTube]] had 5,999 removed, [[Google Groups]] had 7,246 removed, and [[Twitter]] had 4,588 removed.<ref name=":1" /> Though Facebook had the largest number of deleted URLs, there were other received requests that were not granted deletion. While Google does evaluate millions of URLs that have been requested to be removed, the ultimate decision must be made by a human "because the variables, including public interest claims, needs to be handled on a case-by-case basis".<ref name=":1" /> However, it is to be kept in mind that internet users can still find removed information somewhat easily, just not through European Google search engines.

In July 2015, Google accidentally revealed data on delinkings that "shows 95% of Google privacy requests are from citizens out to protect personal and private information – not criminals, politicians and public figures."<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/14/google-accidentally-reveals-right-to-be-forgotten-requests|title = Google accidentally reveals data on 'right to be forgotten' requests|website = The Guardian|last = Tippmann|first = Sylvia|first2 = Julia|last2 = Powles}}</ref>

Argentina's efforts to protect their people's right to be forgotten has been called 'the most complete' because individuals are able to correct, delete, or update information about themselves. Overall, their information is bound to remain confidential.

===United States===
Consideration of the right to be forgotten can be seen in US case law, specifically in ''Melvin v. Reid'', and in ''Sidis v. FR Publishing Corp.''<ref>Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931); Sidis v F-R Publishing Corporation 311 U.S. 711 61 S. Ct. 393 85 L. Ed. 462 1940 U.S.</ref>

In ''Melvin v. Reid'' (1931), an ex-prostitute was charged with murder and then acquitted; she subsequently tried to assume a quiet and anonymous place in society. However, the 1925 film ''[[The Red Kimono]]'' revealed her history, and she successfully sued the producer.<ref>Melvin v.

There is opposition to further recognition of the right to be forgotten in the United States as commentators argue that it will contravene the right to [[freedom of speech]] and freedom of expression, or will constitute [[censorship]], thus potentially breaching peoples' constitutionally protected right to freedom of expression in the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name="theatlantic1">{{cite web|last=Hendel |first=John |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/why-journalists-shouldnt-fear-europes-right-to-be-forgotten/251955/ |title=Why Journalists Shouldn't Fear Europe's 'Right to be Forgotten' |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref> These criticisms are consistent with the proposal that the only information that can be removed by user's request is content that they themselves uploaded.{{clarify|date=July 2017}}<ref name="theatlantic1"/><ref name="walker">Walker, Robert K.

In a June 2014 opinion piece in Forbes, columnist Joseph Steinberg noted that "many privacy protections that Americans believe that they enjoy – even some guaranteed by law – have, in fact, been eroded or even obliterated by technological advances." Steinberg, in explaining the need for legislation guaranteeing the "right to be forgotten", noted that existing laws that require adverse information to be removed from credit reports after a period of time, and that allow the sealing or expunging of criminals records, are effectively undermined by the ability of prospective lenders or employers to forever find the removed information in a matter of seconds by doing a web search.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/06/02/your-privacy-is-now-at-risk-from-search-engines-even-if-the-law-says-otherwise/ |author=Joseph Steinberg |authorlink=Joseph Steinberg |title=Your Privacy Is Now At Risk From Search Engines -- Even If The Law Says Otherwise |publisher=Forbes |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}</ref>

China has one of the longest histories as an entire nation, being over 2000 years of feudal society; their civil laws and personal rights have not been altered through legislative efforts. Nowhere in the country's civil agreement does it discuss the concept of "privacy", more specifically internet privacy, and the growing issue that citizens, "have the right to be forgotten" on the internet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/research/publications/vuwlr/prev-issues/pdf/vol-36-2005/issue-3/jingchun.pdf|title=Protecting the Right to Privacy in China|last=Jingchun|first=Cao|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> There is no data protection authority or a specific state agency set in place to monitor the protection of citizens personal data.

==Connection to international relations==
The regulatory differences in the protection of personal data between countries has real impact on international relations. The right to be forgotten, specifically, is a matter of EU-US relations when applied to cross-border data flow, as it raises questions about territorial sovereignty. The structure of the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian international system]] assumes that the reach of a country's jurisdiction is limited to its geographic territory.<ref name="Stephen J. Kobrin 2004 pp 111-131">{{cite journal | last1 = Kobrin | first1 = Stephen J. | year = 2004 | title = Safe harbours are hard to find: the trans-Atlantic data privacy dispute, territorial jurisdiction and global governance | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 111–131 | doi = 10.1017/S0260210504005856 }}</ref> However, online interactions are independent of geographic location and present across multiple locations, rendering the traditional concept of territorial sovereignty moot.<ref name="Stephen J. Kobrin 2004 pp 111-131"/> Therefore, the EU and the United States are forced to confront their regulatory differences and negotiate on a set of regulations that apply to all foreign companies processing and handling data of European citizens and residents.<ref name="Stephen J. Kobrin 2004 pp 111-131"/>

The regulatory differences on the right to be forgotten along with numerous other data protection rights have shaped discussions and negotiations on trans-Atlantic data privacy regulations. A case in point is the EU and the United States' endeavors to develop the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles|Safe Harbor]] agreement, a data transfer pact that enables the transfer of data between the EU and US companies in a manner consistent with the EU's data protection schemes.<ref name="ReferenceC">The Council: Common Position (EC) no. 95</ref> Article 25 of the Data Protection Directive articulates that cross-border transfer of data can take place only if the "third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection," meaning that the country meets the EU's minimum standards of data protection.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> The standards include, among many provisions, a component that protects the right to "opt out" of further processing or transmission of personal data, under the assumption that data may not be further processed in ways inconsistent with the intent for which they were collected.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> 

Given the inconsistencies between the EU and the United States on numerous [[digital privacy]] regulations, including the right to be forgotten, Article 25 poses a threat to trans-Atlantic data flows. Therefore, the EU and the United States entered into negotiations to mediate the differences through the Safe Harbor agreement, which as a result of debate and discussion between the two parties, requires companies to provide individuals with the choice or opportunity to "opt out" and afford other protections.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

Under the pressures of the mass surveillance carried out by the US government on European citizens' data, the Safe Harbor agreement has been invalidated by the [[European_Court_of_Justice|European Union Court of Justice]] in its [[Max Schrems|''Schrems'' case.]] The Safe Harbor agreement has now been replaced by the [[EU-US_Privacy_Shield|Privacy Shield principles]].

The European Union is a highly influential group of states, and this movement towards the right to be forgotten in the EU is a step towards its global recognition as a right. To support this, in 2012 the Obama Administration released a "Privacy Bill of Rights" to protect consumers online, and while this is not quite the strength of the EU law, it is a step towards recognition of the right to be forgotten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/23/fact-sheet-plan-protect-privacy-internet-age-adopting-consumer-privacy-b |title=Fact Sheet: Plan to Protect Privacy in the Internet Age by Adopting a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights &#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref>

Other criticisms involving the right to be forgotten revolves around the policies for data removal regarding minors. The U.S. has laws in place that protect the privacy of minors.

"A Tory victory on the 8th of June will lead to those youthful indiscretions on Facebook and Twitter being open to erasure. But there are also plans to fine social media firms for not moving at the speed of political opportunism over extreme content."<ref name=":11" /> The United Kingdom has not yet fully adopted the ruling of the [[European Court of Justice]] regarding the right to be forgotten and argued to keep it from going into EU law.{{fact|date=February 2018}} However, in the upcoming elections in the UK laws could be passed to allow minors to remove embarrassing posts or photos on social media that could come back to affect job applications or public image in later life.

[[Theresa May]], the Prime Minister of the UK, has been pushing to extend privacy rights for minors in allowing them to have a right to delete information. The intentions for this extension of privacy are based on the fact that social media sites store years of data that affect minors lives' much later after the information is posted.<ref name=":12">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-12/may-tells-facebook-to-offer-kids-right-to-delete-information|title=May Tells Facebook to Offer Kids the Right to Delete Information|date=2017-05-12|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref> May gave her stance on privacy when she said, "'The Internet has brought a wealth of opportunity but also significant new risks which have evolved faster than society's response to them'".<ref name=":12" /> The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which is headed by May, has pushed for policies that aggressively removes illegal material from the internet and fines firms that do not take action in removing said material.<ref name=":12" />

}}</ref> Google gets many take-down requests at a high volume, so Oblivion is able to help with this problem. Researchers and authors behind Oblivion say that "it is essential to develop techniques that at least partly automate this process and are scalable to internet size."<ref name=":3" /> Oblivion helps the humans that operate the forms at Google ensure that ill-intending users cannot "blacklist links to internet sources that do not affect them."<ref name=":3" /> For example, tests have proven that Oblivion handles requests at a rate of 278 per second.<ref name=":3" /> The software allows Google, the government, and the user to work together to get content removed quickly and for just cause. In order to ensure that the program works quickly, is secure for its users and is impervious to fake take-down requests, Oblivion uses a three-part system.

In the first part, Oblivion requires a user to submit identification about themselves – not limited to "name, age, and nationality."<ref name=":3" /> Oblivion then enables a user to automatically find and tag his or her disseminated personal information using natural language processing and image recognition techniques and file a request in a privacy-preserving manner. Oblivion will scan the article for attributes that match information that has been submitted by the user. Second, Oblivion provides indexing systems with an automated and provable eligibility mechanism, asserting that the author of a request is indeed affected by an online resource. The author of a request is then issued an "ownership token"<ref name=":3" /> that confirms the articles they submitted for evaluation include sensitive personal information. The automated eligibility proof ensures censorship-resistance so that only legitimately affected individuals can request the removal of corresponding links from search results. In the third and last phase, this "ownership token" is submitted to Google, accompanied by the user's concerns as to what information should be deleted.<ref name=":3" /> Google's staff is then allowed to decide for themselves if they want to delete this information or not - but thanks to Oblivion, they know that the information in question is valid.

Researchers with Oblivion, however, have noted that it comes with some limitations. The software is lacking a human element, therefore it cannot decide on its own "whether or not a piece of information is public interest and should therefore not be removed from Google search results."<ref name=":3" /> Researchers have conducted comprehensive evaluations, showing that Oblivion is suitable for large-scale deployment once it is fine-tuned.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}
