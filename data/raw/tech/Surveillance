In [[espionage]] and [[counterintelligence]], '''surveillance''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ər|ˈ|v|eɪ|.|ə|n|s}} or {{IPAc-en|s|ər|ˈ|v|eɪ|l|ə|n|s}})<ref>OED</ref> is the monitoring of [[behavior]], activities, or other changing information for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting people.<ref>Lyon, David. 2007. Surveillance Studies: An Overview. Cambridge: Polity Press.</ref> This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment (such as [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) cameras)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/surveillance-cameras-and-crime |title=The effect of CCTV on public safety: Research roundup |authors=Leighton Walter Kille and Martin Maximino |date=11 February 2014 |work=Journalists Resource |publisher=Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center and the Carnegie-Knight Initiative |accessdate=2015-05-06}}</ref> or interception of electronically transmitted information (such as [[Internet traffic]] or phone calls). It can also include simple no- or relatively low-technology methods such as [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|human intelligence agent]] and [[postal interception]]. The word ''[[Wikt:surveillance|surveillance]]'' comes from a [[French language|French]] phrase for "watching over" (''sur'' means "from above" and ''veiller'' means "to watch") and is in contrast to more recent developments such as [[sousveillance]].<ref>[http://eyetap.org/papers/docs/IEEE_ISTAS13_Sensularity_Minsky_etal.pdf Minsky M, Kurzweil R, Mann S (2013).

Surveillance is used by governments for intelligence gathering, prevention of crime, the protection of a process, person, group or object, or the investigation of crime. It is also used by criminal organisations to plan and commit crimes, such as robbery and kidnapping, by businesses to gather intelligence, and by [[private investigator]]s.

Surveillance can be viewed as a violation of [[privacy]], and as such is often opposed by various [[civil liberties]] groups and activists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/oppose-video-surveillance-our-nations-capital |title=Oppose video surveillance in our nation's capital |publisher=ACLU. org |accessdate=2015-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://rally.stopwatching.us/ |title=Stop watching us – A rally against mass surveillance |publisher=stopwatching.us |accessdate=2015-05-06}}</ref> [[Liberal democracy|Liberal democracies]] have laws which restrict domestic government and private use of surveillance, usually limiting it to circumstances where public safety is at risk. [[Authoritarian]] government seldom have any domestic restrictions, and international [[espionage]] is common among all types of countries.

The area of surveillance is increasingly a topic of academic study,<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080970868640254|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences (Second Edition)|last=Marx|first=Gary T.|date=2015|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080970875|editor-last=Wright|editor-first=James D.|location=Oxford|pages=733–741|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-097086-8.64025-4|chapter=Surveillance Studies}}</ref> including through research centers,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sscqueens.org/|title=The Surveillance Studies Centre {{!}} A multi-disciplinary & international research centre at Queen's University|website=www.sscqueens.org|access-date=2017-06-03}}</ref> books,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Surveillance studies : an overview|last=1948–|first=Lyon, David|date=2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=9780745635927|oclc=145121196}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Introduction-to-Surveillance-Studies/Petersen/p/book/9781466555099|title=Introduction to Surveillance Studies|website=CRC Press|language=en|access-date=2017-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Feminist surveillance studies|last=E.|first=Dubrofsky, Rachel|last2=Shoshana.|first2=Magnet|isbn=9780822358923|oclc=883647071|date = 2015-06-12}}</ref> and peer-reviewed academic journals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/surveillance-and-society|title=Surveillance & Society|website=ojs.library.queensu.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-03}}</ref> "In the future, intelligence services might use the [[internet of things]] for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials," Clapper said.<ref>{{cite news|title=US intelligence chief: we might use the internet of things to spy on you |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/09/internet-of-things-smart-home-devices-government-surveillance-james-clapper|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=18 February 2016|date=2016-02-09|last1=Ackerman|first1=Spencer|last2=Thielman|first2=Sam}}</ref>

The vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of [[data mining|data]] and [[traffic analysis|traffic]] on the [[Internet]].<ref name="sciam-internet">{{cite news|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=internet-eavesdropping|title=Internet Eavesdropping: A Brave New World of Wiretapping |last=Diffie|first=Whitfield|author2=Susan Landau |date=August 2008|work=Scientific American|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref> In the United States for example, under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by federal law enforcement agencies.<ref name="eff-calea-archive">{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html|title=CALEA Archive – Electronic Frontier Foundation|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=March 14, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503035053/http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html|archivedate=May 3, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="eff-calea-summary">{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/calea|title=CALEA: The Perils of Wiretapping the Internet|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}</ref><ref name="eff-calea-faq">{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq|title=CALEA: Frequently Asked Questions|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website)|accessdate=March 14, 2009|date=2007-09-20}}</ref>

There is far too much data on the Internet for human investigators to manually search through all of it. Therefore, automated Internet surveillance computers sift through the vast amount of intercepted Internet traffic to identify and report to human investigators the traffic that is considered interesting or suspicious. This process is regulated by targeting certain "trigger" words or phrases, visiting certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or online chat with suspicious individuals or groups.<ref name="usatoday-chatroom">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|title=Government funds chat room surveillance research|last=Hill|first=Michael|date=October 11, 2004|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}</ref> Billions of dollars per year are spent by agencies, such as the [[NSA]], the [[FBI]] and the now-defunct [[Information Awareness Office]], to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]], [[Narus (company)|NarusInsight]], and [[ECHELON]] to intercept and analyze all of this data to only extract the information which is useful to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.<ref name="zdnet-fbi">{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/fbi-turns-to-broad-new-wiretap-method/151059 |title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=January 30, 2007|work=ZDNet News|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}</ref>

Computers can be a surveillance target because of the personal data stored on them. If someone is able to install software, such as the FBI's [[Magic Lantern (software)|Magic Lantern]] and [[CIPAV]], on a computer system, they can easily gain unauthorized access to this data. Such software could be installed physically or remotely.<ref name="teen-busted-in-wired">{{cite news |url = https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2007/07/fbi_spyware |title = FBI's Secret Spyware Tracks Down Teen Who Made Bomb Threats |date = July 18, 2007 |publisher = Wired Magazine }}</ref> Another form of computer surveillance, known as [[van Eck phreaking]], involves reading electromagnetic emanations from computing devices in order to extract data from them at distances of hundreds of meters.<ref name="emr">{{cite journal | author=Van Eck, Wim | title=Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping Risk? | journal=Computers & Security | volume=4 | year=1985 | pages=269–286 | url=http://jya.com/emr.pdf | doi=10.1016/0167-4048(85)90046-X | issue=4 | citeseerx=10.1.1.35.1695 }}</ref><ref name=Kuhn2004>{{cite journal | author = Kuhn, M.G. | year = 2004 | title = Electromagnetic Eavesdropping Risks of Flat-Panel Displays | journal = 4th Workshop on Privacy Enhancing Technologies | pages = 23–25 | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/pet2004-fpd.pdf }}</ref> The NSA runs a database known as "[[Pinwale]]", which stores and indexes large numbers of emails of both American citizens and foreigners.<ref name="nytimes-email-surveillance">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/us/17nsa.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2&hp|title=E-Mail Surveillance Renews Concerns in Congress |date=June 16, 2009 |work=New York Times|pages=A1|accessdate=June 30, 2009 | first1=James | last1=Risen | first2=Eric | last2=Lichtblau}}</ref><ref name="atlantic-pinwale">{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/06/pinwale-and-the-new-nsa-revelations/19532/ |title=Pinwale And The New NSA Revelations|last=Ambinder|first=Marc|date=June 16, 2009|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=June 30, 2009}}</ref> Additionally, the NSA runs a program known as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], which is a data mining system that gives the United States government direct access to information from technology companies.

===Telephones===
{{Main|Phone surveillance|Lawful interception}}
The official and unofficial tapping of telephone lines is widespread. In the [[United States]] for instance, the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act|Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)]] requires that all telephone and VoIP communications be available for real-time wiretapping by Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.<ref name="eff-calea-archive"/><ref name="eff-calea-summary"/><ref name="eff-calea-faq"/> Two major telecommunications companies in the U.S.—[[AT&T Inc.]] and [[Verizon]]—have contracts with the FBI, requiring them to keep their phone call records easily searchable and accessible for Federal agencies, in return for $1.8 million per year.<ref name="threatlevel-exigent">{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/09/rogue-fbi-lette.html#previouspost|title=Rogue FBI Letters Hint at Phone Companies' Own Data Mining Programs – Updated|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=September 10, 2007|work=Threat Level|publisher=Wired|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}</ref> Between 2003 and 2005, the FBI sent out more than 140,000 "[[National Security Letter]]s" ordering phone companies to hand over information about their customers' calling and Internet histories. About half of these letters requested information on U.S. citizens.<ref name="fbi-national-letters">{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aBd9Zzld22w0&refer=home|title=Mueller Orders Audit of 56 FBI Offices for Secret Subpoenas |last=Roland|first=Neil|date=March 20, 2007|work=Bloomberg News|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}</ref>

Human agents are not required to monitor most calls. [[Speech-to-text]] software creates machine-readable text from intercepted audio, which is then processed by automated call-analysis programs, such as those developed by agencies such as the [[Information Awareness Office]], or companies such as [[Verint]], and [[Narus (company)|Narus]], which search for certain words or phrases, to decide whether to dedicate a human agent to the call.<ref name="latimes-fbi-intel-analysis">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/29/nation/na-technology29|title=FBI Plans to Fight Terror With High-Tech Arsenal|last=Piller|first=Charles|author2=Eric Lichtblau |date=July 29, 2002|work=LA Times|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}</ref>

The [[Stingray phone tracker|StingRay]] tracker is an example of one of these tools used to monitor cell phone usage in the United States and the United Kingdom. Originally developed for counterterrorism purposes by the military, they work by broadcasting powerful signals that cause nearby cell phones to transmit their [[Mobile identification number|IMSI number]], just as they would to normal cell phone towers. Once the phone is connected to the device, there is no way for the user to know that they are being tracked. The operator of the stingray is able to extract information such as location, phone calls, and text messages, but it is widely believed that the capabilities of the StingRay extend much further. A lot of controversy surrounds the StingRay because of its powerful capabilities and the secrecy that surrounds it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hampton|first=Brittany|year=2012|title=From Smartphones to Stingrays: Can the Fourth Amendment Keep up with the Twenty-First Century Note|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/branlaj51&amp;div=8&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals|journal=University of Louisville Law Review|volume=Fifty One|pages=159–176|via=Law Journal Library}}</ref>

Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect location data. The geographical location of a mobile phone (and thus the person carrying it) can be determined easily even when the phone is not being used, using a technique known as [[multilateration]] to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several [[cell towers]] near the owner of the phone.<ref name="bbc-phone-locate">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4738219.stm|title=Tracking a suspect by mobile phone|date=August 3, 2005|work=BBC News|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}</ref><ref name="foxnews-phone-locate">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,509211,00.html|title=Cell Phone Tracking Can Locate Terrorists – But Only Where It's Legal|last=Miller|first=Joshua|date=March 14, 2009|work=FOX News|accessdate=March 14, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318002319/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,509211,00.html|archive-date=March 18, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The legality of such techniques has been questioned in the United States, in particular whether a court warrant is required.<ref name="nyu-lawrev">{{cite web|ssrn=1092293|title=Warrantless Location Tracking|year=2008|work=N.Y.U.

===Cameras===

[[File:Cairns-Lagoon.JPG|thumb|right|A surveillance camera in [[Cairns, Queensland]]]]
[[File:Three Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|right|Surveillance cameras such as these are installed by the millions in many countries, and are nowadays monitored by automated computer programs instead of humans.]]
Surveillance cameras are video cameras used for the purpose of observing an area. They are often connected to a recording device or [[IP network]], and may be watched by a [[security guard]] or [[law enforcement officer]]. Cameras and recording equipment used to be relatively expensive and required human personnel to monitor camera footage, but analysis of footage has been made easier by automated software that organizes digital video footage into a searchable [[database]], and by video analysis software (such as [[VIRAT]] and [[Human Identification at a Distance|HumanID]]). The amount of footage is also drastically reduced by motion sensors which only record when motion is detected. With cheaper production techniques, surveillance cameras are simple and inexpensive enough to be used in home security systems, and for everyday surveillance.

There are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide as of 2016. About 65% of these cameras are installed in Asia. The growth of CCTV has been slowing in recent years.<ref name="SDM2016">{{cite web|url=http://www.sdmmag.com/articles/92407-rise-of-surveillance-camera-installed-base-slows|title=Rise of Surveillance Camera Installed Base Slows|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref> In 2018, China was reported to have a huge surveillance network of over 170 million CCTV cameras with 400 million new cameras expected to be installed in the next three years, many of which use [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-43751276|title=Smart cameras catch man in 60,000 crowd|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In the [[United States]], the [[Department of Homeland Security]] awards billions of dollars per year in [[Homeland Security grants]] for local, state, and federal agencies to install modern video surveillance equipment. For example, the city of [[Chicago]], Illinois, recently used a $5.1 million Homeland Security grant to install an additional 250 surveillance cameras, and connect them to a centralized monitoring center, along with its preexisting network of over 2000 cameras, in a program known as [[Operation Virtual Shield]]. Speaking in 2009, Chicago Mayor [[Richard M.

Examples of mostly behavioral characteristics include gait (a person's manner of walking) or voice.

[[Facial recognition system|Facial recognition]] is the use of the unique configuration of a person's facial features to accurately identify them, usually from surveillance video. Both the Department of Homeland Security and [[DARPA]] are heavily funding research into facial recognition systems.<ref name="usatoday-facial">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-05-10-facial-recognition-terrorism_N.htm|title=Face recognition next in terror fight|last=Frank|first=Thomas|date=May 10, 2007|work=USA Today|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref> The [[Information Processing Technology Office]] ran a program known as [[Human Identification at a Distance]] which developed technologies that are capable of identifying a person at up to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} by their facial features.

Another form of behavioral biometrics, based on [[affective computing]], involves computers recognizing a person's emotional state based on an analysis of their facial expressions, how fast they are talking, the tone and pitch of their voice, their posture, and other behavioral traits.

Marciano proposes four types of harms: Unauthorized use of bodily information, denial or limitation of access to physical spaces, bodily social sorting, and symbolic ineligibility through construction of marginality and otherness. Biometrics' social power, according to Marciano, derives from three main features: their complexity as "enigmatic technologies", their objective-scientific image, and their increasing agency, particularly in the context of automatic decision-making.

[[File:MicroAirVehicle.jpg|thumb|right|Micro Air Vehicle with attached surveillance camera]]

Aerial surveillance is the gathering of surveillance, usually visual imagery or video, from an airborne vehicle—such as an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]], [[helicopter]], or [[surveillance aircraft|spy plane]]. Military [[surveillance aircraft]] use a range of sensors (e.g. radar) to monitor the battlefield.

Digital imaging technology, miniaturized computers, and numerous other technological advances over the past decade have contributed to rapid advances in aerial surveillance hardware such as [[micro-aerial vehicles]], [[forward-looking infrared]], and high-resolution imagery capable of identifying objects at extremely long distances. For instance, the [[MQ-9 Reaper]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.military.com/equipment/mq-9-reaper|title=MQ-9 Reaper|last=Boyd|first=Ryan|language=en|access-date=2016-10-05}}</ref> a U.S. drone plane used for domestic operations by the [[Department of Homeland Security]], carries cameras that are capable of identifying an object the size of a milk carton from altitudes of 60,000 feet, and has [[forward-looking infrared]] devices that can detect the heat from a human body at distances of up to 60 kilometers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/the-rapid-rise-of-federal-surveillance-drones-over-america/473136/|title=The Rapid Rise of Federal Surveillance Drones Over America|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-05|date=2016-03-10}}</ref> In an earlier instance of commercial aerial surveillance, the [[Killington Mountain]] ski resort hired 'eye in the sky' aerial photography of its competitors' parking lots to judge the success of its marketing initiatives as it developed starting in the 1950s.<ref>Edwards, Bruce, [http://www.vermonttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/RH/20121109/BUSINESS03/711099916 "Killington co-founder Sargent dead at 83"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904091030/http://www.vermonttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2FRH%2F20121109%2FBUSINESS03%2F711099916 |date=September 4, 2015 }}, Rutland ''Herald'', November 9, 2012.

Programs such as the [[Heterogeneous Aerial Reconnaissance Team]] program developed by [[DARPA]] have automated much of the aerial surveillance process. They have developed systems consisting of large teams drone planes that pilot themselves, automatically decide who is "suspicious" and how to go about monitoring them, coordinate their activities with other drones nearby, and notify human operators if something suspicious is occurring. This greatly increases the amount of area that can be continuously monitored, while reducing the number of human operators required. Thus a swarm of automated, self-directing drones can automatically patrol a city and track suspicious individuals, reporting their activities back to a centralized monitoring station.<ref name="hart-overview">{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/programs/hart/docs/HART_Overview.pdf|title=HART Overview|date=August 2008|work=IPTO (DARPA) – Official website|accessdate=March 15, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205233843/http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/programs/hart/docs/HART_Overview.pdf|archivedate=December 5, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="hart-proposal">{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicit/baa/BAA-04-05_PIP.pdf |title=BAA 04-05-PIP: Heterogeneous Airborne Reconnaissance Team (HART) |date=December 5, 2003 |work=Information Processing Technology Office (DARPA) – Official Website |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127074930/http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicit/baa/BAA-04-05_PIP.pdf |archivedate=November 27, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="defense-daily">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_40_236/ai_n29399227 |title=DARPA, Northrop Grumman Move Into Next Phase of UAV Control Architecture |last=Sirak |first=Michael |date=Nov 29, 2007 |work=Defense Daily |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309060941/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_40_236/ai_n29399227/ |archivedate=March 9, 2012 |df= }}</ref>

===Data mining and profiling===
[[Data mining]] is the application of statistical techniques and programmatic algorithms to discover previously unnoticed relationships within the data. [[Data profiling]] in this context is the process of assembling information about a particular individual or group in order to generate a profile&nbsp;— that is, a picture of their patterns and behavior. Data profiling can be an extremely powerful tool for psychological and [[social network analysis]]. A skilled analyst can discover facts about a person that they might not even be consciously aware of themselves.<ref name="profiling-euro">{{cite book|authorlink1=Mireille Hildebrandt|last=Hildebrandt|first=Mireille|author2=Serge Gutwirth |title=Profiling the European Citizen: Cross Disciplinary Perspectives|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4020-6913-0}}</ref>

Economic (such as credit card purchases) and social (such as telephone calls and emails) transactions in modern society create large amounts of stored [[data]] and records. In the past, this data was documented in paper records, leaving a "[[paper trail]]", or was simply not documented at all. Correlation of paper-based records was a laborious process—it required human intelligence operators to manually dig through documents, which was time-consuming and incomplete, at best.

But today many of these records are electronic, resulting in an "[[Digital footprint|electronic trail]]". Every use of a bank machine, payment by credit card, use of a phone card, call from home, checked out library book, rented video, or otherwise complete recorded transaction generates an electronic record. Public records—such as birth, court, tax and other records—are increasily being digitized and made available online. In addition, due to laws like [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act|CALEA]], web traffic and online purchases are also available for profiling. Electronic record-keeping makes data easily collectable, storable, and accessible—so that high-volume, efficient aggregation and analysis is possible at significantly lower costs.

Information relating to many of these individual transactions is often easily available because it is generally not guarded in isolation, since the information, such as the title of a movie a person has rented, might not seem sensitive. However, when many such transactions are [[government databases|aggregated]] they can be used to assemble a detailed profile revealing the actions, habits, beliefs, locations frequented, [[social network analysis|social connections]], and preferences of the individual. This profile is then used, by programs such as [[ADVISE]]<ref name="data-sweep">{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0209/p01s02-uspo.html|title=US Plans Massive Data Sweep|last=Clayton|first=Mark|date=February 9, 2006|work=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref> and [[TALON (database)|TALON]], to determine whether the person is a military, criminal, or political threat.

In addition to its own aggregation and profiling tools, the government is able to access information from third parties&nbsp;— for example, banks, credit companies or employers, etc.&nbsp;— by requesting access informally, by compelling access through the use of subpoenas or other procedures,<ref name="cdt-fbi-subpoenas">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdt.org/security/usapatriot/030924cdt.shtml |title=Administrative Subpoenas for the FBI: A Grab for Unchecked Executive Power |last=Flint |first=Lara |date=September 24, 2003 |work=The Center For Democracy & Technology (official site) |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308183232/http://cdt.org/security/usapatriot/030924cdt.shtml |archivedate=March 8, 2009 }}</ref> or by purchasing data from commercial data aggregators or data brokers. The United States has spent $370 million on its 43 planned [[fusion centers]], which are national network of surveillance centers that are located in over 30 states. The centers will collect and analyze vast amounts of data on U.S. citizens. It will get this data by consolidating personal information from sources such as state driver's licensing agencies, hospital records, criminal records, school records, credit bureaus, banks, etc. – and placing this information in a centralized database that can be accessed from all of the centers, as well as other federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.<ref name="epic-fusion-centers">{{cite web|url=http://epic.org/privacy/surveillance/spotlight/0607/default.html|title="National Network" of Fusion Centers Raises Specter of COINTELPRO|date=June 2007|work= EPIC Spotlight on Surveillance|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}</ref>

Under ''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=425&invol=435 United States v. Miller]'' (1976), data held by third parties is generally not subject to [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] warrant requirements.

===Corporate===
Corporate surveillance is the monitoring of a person or group's behavior by a corporation. The data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations, but is also regularly shared with government agencies. It can be used as a form of [[business intelligence]], which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and/or services to be desirable by their customers. Although there is a common belief that monitoring can increase productivity, it can also create consequences such as increasing chances of deviant behavior and creating punishments that are not equitable to their actions. Additionally, monitoring can cause resistance and backlash because it insinuates an employer’s suspicion and lack of trust.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=Denise|date=2017|title=Toward a Sociology of Privacy|url=|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=43|issue=1|pages=249–269|via=}}</ref>

====Business Intelligence====
Data collected on individuals and groups can be sold to other corporations, so that they can use it for the aforementioned purpose. It can be used for [[direct marketing]] purposes, such as targeted advertisements on Google and Yahoo. These ads are tailored to the individual user of the search engine by analyzing their search history and emails<ref name="nytimes-onlineads">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/technology/01Privacy.html?_r=1|title=F.T.C. to Review Online Ads and Privacy|last=Story|first=Louise|date=November 1, 2007|work=New York Times|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}</ref> (if they use free webmail services), which is kept in a database.<ref name="surv-in-society">{{cite news|url=https://thestarphoenix.com/Technology/Surveillance+society/1322333/story.html|title=Surveillance in society|last=Butler|first=Don|date=February 24, 2009|work=The Star Phoenix|publisher=CanWest|accessdate=March 17, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

====Intra-Corporate Surveillance====
According to the [[American Management Association]] and the ePolicy Institute that undertake an annual quantitative survey about electronic monitoring and surveillance with approximately 300 U.S. companies, "more than one fourth of employers have fired workers for misusing e-mail and nearly one third have fired employees for misusing the Internet".<ref name="stacy">American Management Association and the ePolicy Institute (2008). [http://press.amanet.org/press-releases/177/2007-electronic-monitoring-surveillance-survey Electronic Monitoring and Surveillance 2007 Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801095437/http://press.amanet.org/press-releases/177/2007-electronic-monitoring-surveillance-survey/ |date=August 1, 2012 }}. Retrieved July 27, 2012.</ref> More than 40% of the companies monitor e-mail traffic of their workers, and 66% of corporations monitor Internet connections. In addition, most companies use software to block non-work related websites such as sexual or pornographic sites, game sites, social networking sites, entertainment sites, shopping sites, and sport sites. The American Management Association and the ePolicy Institute also stress that companies "tracking content, keystrokes, and time spent at the keyboard ... store and review computer files ... monitor the blogosphere to see what is being written about the company, and ... monitor social networking sites".<ref name="stacy"/> Furthermore, about 30% of the companies had also fired employees for non-work related email and Internet usage such as "inappropriate or offensive language" and "viewing, downloading, or uploading inappropriate/offensive content".<ref name="stacy"/><ref>Allmer, Thomas (2012).

====Government Use of Corporate Surveillance Data====
The United States government often gains access to these databases, either by producing a warrant for it, or by simply asking. The [[Department of Homeland Security]] has openly stated that it uses data collected from consumer credit and direct marketing agencies—such as Google—for augmenting the profiles of individuals whom it is monitoring.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nation.time.com/2013/08/01/the-surveillance-society/|title=The Surveillance Society|last=Drehle|first=David Von|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-10-05}}</ref> The FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and other intelligence agencies have formed an "information-sharing" partnership with over 34,000 corporations as part of their [[Infragard]] program.

The U.S. Federal government has gathered information from grocery store "discount card" programs, which track customers' shopping patterns and store them in databases, in order to look for "terrorists" by analyzing shoppers' buying patterns.<ref name="fox-store-cards">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,59262,00.html|title=Store Customer Cards a Source for FBI?|last=Vlahos|first=Kelley|date=August 1, 2002|work=FOX News|accessdate=March 17, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512033933/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,59262,00.html|archive-date=May 12, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Human operatives===
Organizations that have enemies who wish to gather information about the groups' members or activities face the issue of infiltration.<ref name="fbi-anna">{{cite news|url=http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2006/01/332735.shtml|title=Information on the Confidential Source in the Auburn Arrests|last=anonymous|date=Jan 26, 2006|work=Portland Indymedia|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref><ref name="pentagon-infiltration">{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10454316|title=Is the Pentagon spying on Americans?|last=Myers|first=Lisa|date=December 14, 2005|work=NBC Nightly News|publisher=msnbc.com|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>

In addition to operatives' infiltrating an organization, the surveilling party may exert pressure on certain members of the target organization to act as [[informants]] (i.e., to disclose the information they hold on the organization and its members).<ref name="senate-hearing-informants">{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIId.htm|title=The Use of Informants in FBI Domestic Intelligence Investigations |work=Final Report: Book III, Supplementary Detailed Staff Reports on Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans |pages=225–270 |date=April 23, 1976 |publisher=U.S. Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities |accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2010/jun/15/secret-justice-criminal-informants-and-americas-underground-legal-system/ |title= Secret Justice: Criminal Informants and America's Underground Legal System {{!}} Prison Legal News |website= www.prisonlegalnews.org |access-date= 2016-10-05}}</ref>

Fielding operatives is very expensive, and for governments with wide-reaching electronic surveillance tools at their disposal the information recovered from operatives can often be obtained from less problematic forms of surveillance such as those mentioned above. Nevertheless, human infiltrators are still common today. For instance, in 2007 documents surfaced showing that the [[FBI]] was planning to field a total of 15,000 undercover agents and informants in response to an anti-terrorism directive sent out by George W. Bush in 2004 that ordered intelligence and law enforcement agencies to increase their [[HUMINT]] capabilities.<ref name="fbi-informant-network">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/07/fbi-proposes-bu.html|title=FBI Proposes Building Network of U.S. Informants|last=Ross|first=Brian|date=July 25, 2007|work=Blotter|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>

===Satellite imagery===
{{Main|Reconnaissance satellite}}
On May 25, 2007 the U.S. [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[John Michael McConnell|Michael McConnell]] authorized the [[National Applications Office|National Applications Office (NAO)]] of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] to allow local, state, and domestic Federal agencies to access imagery from [[military intelligence]] [[Reconnaissance satellite]]s and [[Reconnaissance aircraft]] sensors which can now be used to observe the activities of U.S. citizens. The satellites and aircraft sensors will be able to penetrate cloud cover, detect chemical traces, and identify objects in buildings and "underground bunkers", and will provide real-time video at much higher resolutions than the still-images produced by programs such as [[Google Earth]].<ref name="ns-archive-domestic-sat">{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB229/index.htm|title=U.S. Reconnaissance Satellites: Domestic Targets|work=National Security Archive|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name="wsj-domestic-sat">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118714764716998275 |title=U.S. to Expand Domestic Use Of Spy Satellites|last=Block|first=Robert|date=August 15, 2007|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}</ref><ref name="wsj-sat-program-approved">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122282336428992785?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Satellite-Surveillance Program to Begin Despite Privacy Concerns |last=Gorman|first=Siobhan|date=October 1, 2008|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name="dhs-nao-factsheet">{{cite news|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1187188414685.shtm |title=Fact Sheet: National Applications Office |date=August 15, 2007 |work=Department of Homeland Security (official website) |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311151910/http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1187188414685.shtm |archivedate=March 11, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name="washpost-sat">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/15/AR2007081502430_pf.html|title=Domestic Use of Spy Satellites To Widen|last=Warrick|first=Joby|date=August 16, 2007|work=Washington Post|pages=A01|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}</ref><ref name="usatoday-spysat">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-09-26-civilian-spying_x.htm|title=Spy imagery agency watching inside U.S.|last=Shrader|first=Katherine|date=September 26, 2004|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}</ref>

===Identification and credentials===
[[File:Social Security card.jpg|thumb|right|A card containing an identification number]]

One of the simplest forms of identification is the carrying of credentials. Some nations have an [[Identity document|identity card]] system to aid identification, whilst others are considering it but face public opposition. Other documents, such as [[passport]]s, driver's licenses, library cards, banking or credit cards are also used to verify identity.

If the form of the identity card is "machine-readable", usually using an encoded magnetic stripe or identification number (such as a [[Social Security number]]), it corroborates the subject's identifying data. In this case it may create an electronic trail when it is checked and scanned, which can be used in profiling, as mentioned above.

===RFID and geolocation devices===
[[File:RFID hand 1.jpg|thumb|right|Hand with planned insertion point for Verichip device]]

====RFID tagging====
[[Radio Frequency Identification]] (RFID) tagging is the use of very small electronic devices (called "RFID tags") which are applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. The tags can be read from several meters away. They are extremely inexpensive, costing a few cents per piece, so they can be inserted into many types of everyday products without significantly increasing the price, and can be used to track and identify these objects for a variety of purposes.

Some companies appear to be "tagging" their workers by incorporating RFID tags in employee ID badges. Workers in U.K. considered [[strike action]] in protest of having themselves tagged; they felt that it was [[dehumanisation|dehumanizing]] to have all of their movements tracked with RFID chips.<ref name="rfid-strike-uk">{{cite news|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/print/6294|title=Two Stories Highlight the RFID Debate|date=July 19, 2005|work=RFID Journal|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}</ref>{{vague|date=March 2012}} Some critics have expressed fears that people will soon be tracked and scanned everywhere they go.<ref name="usatoday-verichip"/>  On the other hand, RFID tags in newborn baby ID bracelets put on by hospitals have foiled kidnappings.<ref name="rfid-strike-uk" />

[[Verichip]] is an RFID device produced by a company called Applied Digital Solutions (ADS). Verichip is slightly larger than a grain of rice, and is injected under the skin. The injection reportedly feels similar to receiving a [[Injection (medicine)|shot]]. The chip is encased in glass, and stores a "VeriChip Subscriber Number" which the scanner uses to access their personal information, via the Internet, from Verichip Inc.'s database, the "Global VeriChip Subscriber Registry".

In a 2003 editorial, CNET News.com's chief political correspondent, Declan McCullagh, speculated that, soon, every object that is purchased, and perhaps ID cards, will have RFID devices in them, which would respond with information about people as they walk past scanners (what type of phone they have, what type of shoes they have on, which books they are carrying, what credit cards or membership cards they have, etc.). This information could be used for identification, tracking, or [[targeted marketing]]. {{as of|2012}}, this has largely not come to pass.<ref name="mccullagh-rfid">{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/2010-1069-980325.html|title=RFID Tags: Big Brother in small packages|last=McCullagh |first=Declan|date=January 13, 2003|work=CNET News|accessdate=July 24, 2012}}</ref>

====Mobile phones====
Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect geolocation data. The geographical location of a mobile phone (and thus the person carrying it) can be determined easily (whether it is being used or not), using a technique known [[multilateration]] to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several [[cell towers]] near the owner of the phone.<ref name="bbc-phone-locate"/><ref name="foxnews-phone-locate"/> Dr. Victor Kappeler<ref>{{cite web|last=Kappeler|first=Victor|title=Forget the NSA: Police May be a Greater Threat to Privacy|url=http://www.plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/forget-nsa-police-may-be-greater-threat-privacy}}</ref>  of Eastern Kentucky University indicates that police surveillance is a strong concern, stating the following statistics from 2013:
{{quote|Of the 321,545 law enforcement requests made to Verizon, 54,200 of these requests were for "content" or "location" information—not just cell phone numbers or IP addresses.

A comparatively new off-the-shelf surveillance device is an [[IMSI-catcher]], a [[Telephone tapping|telephone eavesdropping]] device used to intercept mobile phone traffic and track the movement of mobile phone users. Essentially a "fake" [[cell site|mobile tower]] acting between the target mobile phone and the service provider's real towers, it is considered a [[man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] (MITM) attack. IMSI-catchers are used in some countries by [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] and [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], but their use has raised significant civil liberty and privacy concerns and is strictly regulated in some countries.<ref>{{citation | chapter=Section 100i – IMS I-Catcher | title=The German Code Of Criminal Procedure | chapter-url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stpo/german_code_of_criminal_procedure.pdf | pages=43–44 | year=2014 | access-date=November 27, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925164238/http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stpo/german_code_of_criminal_procedure.pdf | archive-date=September 25, 2015 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Human microchips===
{{Main|Microchip implant (human)}}

A human microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit device or [[RFID]] transponder encased in [[silicate glass]] and implanted in the body of a human being.  A [[subdermal implant]] typically contains a unique ID number that can be linked to information contained in an external database, such as personal identification, medical history, medications, allergies, and contact information.

Several types of microchips have been developed in order to control and monitor certain types of people, such as criminals, political figures and spies,{{Clarify|date=February 2016}} a "killer" tracking chip patent was filed at the German Patent and Trademark Office (DPMA) around May 2009.

{{See also|United States v. Spy Factory, Inc.}}
[[Covert listening device]]s and video devices, or "bugs", are hidden electronic devices which are used to capture, record, and/or transmit data to a receiving party such as a law enforcement agency.

The U.S. has run numerous domestic intelligence operations, such as [[COINTELPRO]], which have bugged the homes, offices, and vehicles of thousands of U.S. citizens, usually [[political activists]], [[subversives]], and [[criminals]].<ref name="wolf-cointelpro">{{cite web|url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/cointel.htm|title=COINTELPRO|last=Wolf|first=Paul|work=(online collection of historical documents)|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}</ref>

===Postal services===
As more people use faxes and e-mail the significance of surveilling the postal system is decreasing, in favor of Internet and telephone surveillance. But interception of post is still an available option for law enforcement and intelligence agencies, in certain circumstances.{{citation needed |date=May 2015}} This is not a common practice, however, and entities like the US Army require high levels of approval to conduct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/r381_10.pdf |title=U.S. Army Intelligence Activities |accessdate=25 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808002021/http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/r381_10.pdf |archivedate=August 8, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>

===Stakeout===
{{Redirect|Stakeout}}
A '''stakeout''' is the coordinated surveillance of a location or person. Stakeouts are generally performed [[covert]]ly and for the purpose of gathering [[evidence]] related to [[criminal activity]]. The term derives from the practice by [[land surveyor]]s of using [[survey stakes]] to measure out an area before the main building project is commenced.

=== Wildlife ===
The management of wildlife populations often requires surveillance.

==Controversy==
[[File:Bansky one nation under cctv.jpg|thumb|right|Graffiti expressing concern about proliferation of video surveillance]]

===Support===

Supporters of surveillance systems believe that these tools can help protect society from [[terrorists]] and [[criminals]]. They argue that surveillance can reduce crime by three means: by deterrence, by observation, and by reconstruction. Surveillance can deter by increasing the chance of being caught, and by revealing the [[modus operandi]]. This requires a minimal level of [[invasive observation|invasiveness]].<ref name ="Deviant Behaviour - Socially accepted observation of behaviour for security">[http://www.fp7-tactics.eu/files/documents/Deviant%20Behaviour-Socially%20accepted%20observation%20of%20behaviour%20for%20security.pdf Deviant Behaviour – Socially accepted observation of behaviour for security], Jeroen van Rest</ref>

Another method on how surveillance can be used to fight criminal activity is by linking the information stream obtained from them to a recognition system (for instance, a camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system). This can for instance auto-recognize fugitives and direct police to their location.

A distinction here has to be made however on the type of surveillance employed. Some people that say support video surveillance in city streets may not support indiscriminate telephone taps and vice versa. Besides the types, the way in how this surveillance is done also matters a lot; i.e. indiscriminate telephone taps are supported by much fewer people than say telephone taps only done to people suspected of engaging in illegal activities.

Surveillance can also be used to give human operatives a tactical advantage through improved situational awareness, or through the use of automated processes, i.e. [[video analytics]]. Surveillance can help reconstruct an incident and prove guilt through the availability of footage for forensics experts. Surveillance can also influence subjective security if surveillance resources are visible or if the consequences of surveillance can be felt.

Some of the surveillance systems (such as the camera system that has its feed run through a facial recognition system mentioned above) can also have other uses besides countering criminal activity. For instance, it can help on retrieving runaway children, abducted or missing adults and mentally disabled people. 
Other supporters simply believe that there is nothing that can be done about the loss of privacy, and that people must become accustomed to having no privacy. As [[Sun Microsystems]] CEO [[Scott McNealy]] said: "You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it."<ref name="sun-getoverit">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/1999/01/17538|title=Sun on Privacy: 'Get Over It'|last=Sprenger|first=Polly|date=January 26, 1999|work=Wired Magazine|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}</ref><ref name="bw-getoverit">{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_14/b3623028.htm |title=Privacy |last=Baig |first=Edward |author2=Marcia Stepanek |author3=Neil Gross |date=April 5, 1999 |work=Business Week |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017102602/http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_14/b3623028.htm |archivedate=October 17, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Another common argument is: "[[nothing to hide argument|If you aren't doing something wrong then you don't have anything to fear]]." Which follows that if one is engaging in unlawful activities, in which case they do not have a legitimate justification for their privacy. However, if they are following the law the surveillance would not affect them.<ref>{{cite journal|author=[[Daniel J. Solove|Solove, Daniel]]|title='I've Got Nothing to Hide' and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy|journal=San Diego Law Review|year=2007|volume=44|page=745|ssrn=998565}}</ref>

===Opposition===
[[File:UncleSamListensIn.jpg|thumb|upright|An elaborate [[Sgraffito|graffito]] in Columbus, Ohio, depicting state surveillance of [[telecommunications]] ]]

With the advent of programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program and [[ADVISE]], technologies such as [[NarusInsight|high speed surveillance computers]] and [[Surveillance#Biometric|biometrics]] software, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]], governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of their subjects.<ref name="us-surveillance-soc">{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/privacy/gen/index.html|title=Is the U.S. Turning Into a Surveillance Society?|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref> Many [[civil rights]] and [[privacy]] groups, such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and [[American Civil Liberties Union]], have expressed concern that by allowing continual increases in government surveillance of citizens we will end up in a [[mass surveillance]] society, with extremely limited, or non-existent political and/or personal freedoms. Fears such as this have led to numerous lawsuits such as ''[[Hepting v. AT&T]]''.<ref name="us-surveillance-soc"/><ref name="bigger-monster">{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/aclu_report_bigger_monster_weaker_chains.pdf|title=Bigger Monster, Weaker Chains: The Growth of an American Surveillance Society|date=January 15, 2003|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>

Some critics state that the claim made by supporters should be modified to read: "As long as we do what we're told, we have nothing to fear.".<!-- [103] --> For instance, a person who is part of a political group which opposes the policies of the national government, might not want the government to know their names and what they have been reading, so that the government cannot easily subvert their organization, arrest, or kill them.<!-- [104] --> Other critics state that while a person might not have anything to hide right now, the government might later implement policies that they do wish to oppose, and that opposition might then be impossible due to mass surveillance enabling the government to identify and remove political threats.<!-- [103] --><!-- [105] --> Further, other critics point to the fact that most people ''do'' have things to hide.<!-- [102] --><!-- [104] --> For example, if a person is looking for a new job, they might not want their current employer to know this.<!-- [106] --> Also if an employer wishes total privacy to watch over their own employee and secure their financial information it may become impossible, and they may not wish to hire those under surveillance. The most concern of detriment is securing the lives of those who live under total surveillance willingly, educating the public to those under peaceful watch while identifying terrorist and those who use the same surveillance systems and mechanisms in opposition to peace, against civilians, and to disclose lives removed from the laws of the land.

In addition, a significant risk of private data collection stems from the fact that this risk is too much unknown to be readily assessed today. Storage is cheap enough to have data stored forever, and the models using which it will be analyzed in a decade from now cannot reasonably be foreseen.<ref name="privacy-hbarel">{{cite news|url=http://www.hbarel.com/index.php/against-the-collection-of-private|title=Against the collection of private data: The unknown risk factor|date=March 8, 2012}}</ref>

====Totalitarianism====
[[File:Sur-veillance-trafficcam-glog.jpg|thumb|upright|A traffic camera atop a high pole oversees a road in the Canadian city of Toronto]]

Programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]] have led many groups to fear that society is moving towards a state of [[mass surveillance]] with severely limited personal, social, political freedoms, where dissenting individuals or groups will be strategically removed in [[COINTELPRO]]-like purges.<ref name="us-surveillance-soc"/><ref name="bigger-monster"/>

Kate Martin, of the Center For National Security Studies said of the use of military spy satellites being used to monitor the activities of U.S. citizens: "They are laying the bricks one at a time for a police state."<ref name="washpost-sat"/>

Some point to the blurring of lines between public and private places, and the privatization of places traditionally seen as public (such as shopping malls and industrial parks) as illustrating the increasing legality of collecting personal information.<ref name="Marx et al, 2007">Marx, G.

====Psychological/social effects====
{{See also|Hawthorne effect}}
Some critics, such as [[Michel Foucault]], believe that in addition to its obvious function of identifying and capturing individuals who are committing undesirable acts, surveillance also functions to create in everyone a feeling of always being watched, so that they become self-policing. This allows the State to control the populace without having to resort to physical force, which is expensive and otherwise problematic.<ref name="foucault-discipline">{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|year=1979|pages=201–202}}</ref>

The concept of panopticism is a means of indirect control over a large populace through the uncertainty of surveillance. Michel Foucault analyzed the architecture of the prison panopticon, and realized that its success was not just in its ability to monitor but also its ability to not monitor without anyone knowing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish|date=1995|publisher=Random House|location=New York|pages=200–203}}</ref> 
Critics such as Derrick Jensen and George Draffan, argue that panopticism in the United States began in World War I when the issuing of passports became important for the tracking of citizens and possibly enemies of the state. Such surveillance continues today through government agencies in the form of tracking internet usage and library usage.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=Derrick|title= Welcome to the Machine: Science, Surveillance and the Culture of Control|date=2004|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=Vermont|pages=112–124}}</ref>

With the development of digital technology, individuals have become increasingly perceptible to one another, as surveillance becomes virtual. Online surveillance is the utilization of the internet to observe one's activity.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Superconnected: the internet, digital media, and techno-social life|last=Chayko|first=Mary|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2017|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref> Corporations, citizens, and governments participate in tracking others' behaviours for motivations that arise out of business relations, to curiosity, to legality. In her book ''Superconnected'', Chayko differentiates between two types of surveillance: vertical and horizontal.<ref name=":1" /> Vertical surveillance occurs when there is a dominant force, such as the government that is attempting to control or regulate the actions of a given society. Such powerful authorities often justify their incursions as a means to protect society from threats of violence or terrorism. Some individuals question when this becomes an infringement on civil rights.<ref name=":1" />

Horizontal diverges from vertical surveillance as the tracking shifts from an authoritative source to an everyday figure, such as a friend, coworker, or stranger that is interested in one's mundane activities.<ref name=":1" /> Individuals leave traces of information when they are online that reveal their interests and desires of which others observe. While this can allow people to become interconnected and develop social connections online, it can also increase potential risk to harm, such as [[cyberbullying]] or censoring/stalking by strangers, reducing privacy.<ref name=":1" />

Michel Foucault has expanded literature on discipline and power structures within society, specifically by developing Jeremy Bentham's notion of the [[panopticon]]. This metaphor has been used to illustrate the influence of surveillance on the individual, in addition to society as a collective. The panopticon is a circular prison design in which prison guards are located within the center of the facility, monitoring the prisoners who are invisible to one another.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Discipline and Punish: The Birth of Prison|last=Foucault|first=Michel|publisher=Vintage|year=1977|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> Although the inmates are not consistently observed, they are nevertheless obliged to abide by the rules due to the perception that they are under surveillance. This is similar to the contemporary prevalence of undercover police and highway trackers. An example of video surveillance is called closed-circuit television ([[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]), which are used to reduce crime and increase public safety.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sheldon|first=Barrie|date=October 2011|title=Camera surveillance within the UK: Enhancing public safety or a social threat?|url=|journal=International Review of Law, Computers & Technology|volume=25|pages=193–203|via=}}</ref> Regulation is maintained both through vertical and self-surveillance.

====Privacy====
Numerous [[civil rights]] groups and [[privacy]] groups oppose surveillance as a violation of people's right to privacy. Such groups include: [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]], [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[American Civil Liberties Union]]

There have been several lawsuits such as [[Hepting v. AT&T]] and [[EPIC v. Department of Justice]] by groups or individuals, opposing certain surveillance activities.

Legislative proceedings such as those that took place during the [[Church Committee]], which investigated domestic intelligence programs such as [[COINTELPRO]], have also weighed the pros and cons of surveillance.

;Court Cases

[[People v. Diaz|People vs. Diaz (2011)]] was a court case in the realm of cell phone privacy, even though the decision was later overturned. In this case, Gregory Diaz was arrested during a sting operation for attempting to sell ecstasy.  During his arrest, police searched Diaz's phone and found more incriminating evidence including SMS text messages and photographs depicting illicit activities.  During his trial, Diaz attempted to have the information from his cell phone removed from evidence, but the courts deemed it as lawful and Diaz's appeal was denied on the California State Court level and, later, the Supreme Court level.  Just three short years after, this decision was overturned in the case Riley vs. California (2014).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1033744.html|title=People vs. Diaz|last=Court of Appeal, Second District, Division 6, California.|date=July 30, 2008|website=FindLaw|access-date=Feb 1, 2017}}</ref>

[[Riley v. California|Riley vs. California (2014)]] was an extremely vital [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] case in which a man was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting.  A few days after the shooting the police made an arrest of the suspect (Riley), and, during the arrest, the police searched him.  However, this search was not only of Riley's person, but also the police opened and searched his cell phone, finding pictures of other weapons, drugs, and of Riley showing gang signs.  In court, the question arose whether searching the phone was lawful or if the search was protected by the 4th amendment of the constitution.  The decision held that the search of Riley's cell phone during the arrest was illegal, and that it was protected by the 4th Amendment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/13-132|title=Riley v.

==Countersurveillance, inverse surveillance, sousveillance==
[[Countersurveillance]] is the practice of avoiding surveillance or making surveillance difficult. Developments in the late twentieth century have caused counter surveillance to dramatically grow in both scope and complexity, such as the Internet, increasing prevalence of electronic [[security systems]], high-altitude (and possibly armed) [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]], and large corporate and government computer databases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stratfor.com/secrets_countersurveillance|title=The Secrets of Countersurveillance|publisher=Security Weekly|date=June 6, 2007}}</ref>

[[Inverse surveillance]] is the practice of the reversal of surveillance on other individuals or groups (e.g., citizens photographing police). Well-known examples are [[Rodney King|George Holliday]]'s recording of the [[Rodney King]] beating and the organization [[Copwatch]], which attempts to monitor police officers to prevent [[police brutality]].  Counter-surveillance can be also used in applications to prevent corporate spying, or to track other criminals by certain criminal entities. It can also be used to deter stalking methods used by various entities and organizations.

''[[Sousveillance]]'' is inverse surveillance, involving the recording by private individuals, rather than government or corporate entities.<ref>{{cite news

==Popular culture==
===In literature===
* [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' portrays a fictional [[totalitarian]] surveillance society with a very simple (by today's standards) [[mass surveillance]] system consisting of human operatives, informants, and two-way "telescreens" in people's homes. Because of the impact of this book, mass-surveillance technologies are commonly called "Orwellian" when they are considered problematic.
* The novel ''[[mistrust]]'' highlights the negative effects from the overuse of surveillance at Reflection House. The central character Kerryn installs secret cameras to monitor her housemates – see also [[Paranoia]].
* The book ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', as well as a film and TV series based on it, portray a totalitarian Christian [[theocracy]] where all citizens are kept under constant surveillance.
* In the book ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', [[Lisbeth Salander]] uses computers to get information on people, as well as other common surveillance methods, as a freelancer.
* [[Dave Eggers|David Egger's]] novel ''[[The Circle (Eggers novel)|The Circle]]'' exhibits a world where a single company called "The Circle" produces all of the latest and highest quality technologies from computers and smartphones, to surveillance cameras known as "See-Change cameras". This company becomes associated with politics when starting a movement where politicians go "transparent" by wearing See-Change cameras on their body to prevent keeping secrets from the public about their daily work activity. In this society, it becomes mandatory to share personal information and experiences because it is The Circle's belief that everyone should have access to all information freely. However, as Eggers illustrates, this takes a toll on the individuals and creates a disruption of power between the governments and the private company. The Circle presents extreme ideologies surrounding mandatory surveillance. Eamon Bailey, one of the Wise Men, or founders of The Circle, believes that possessing the tools to access information about anything or anyone, should be a human right given to all of the world's citizens.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Circle|last=Eggers|first=David|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf, McSweeney's Books|year=2013|isbn=978-0-385-35139-3|location=New York|pages=288, 290–291, 486}}</ref> By eliminating all secrets, any behaviour that has been deemed shameful will either become normalized or no longer considered shocking. Negative actions will eventually be eradicated from society altogether, through the fear of being exposed to other citizens<ref name=":0" /> This would be achieved in part by everyone going transparent, something that Bailey highly supports, although it's notable that none of the Wise Men ever became transparent themselves. One major goal of The Circle is to have all of the world's information filtered through The Circle, a process they call "Completion".<ref name=":0" /> A single, private company would then have full access and control over all information and privacy of individuals and governments. Ty Gospodinov, the first founder of The Circle, has major concerns about the completion of the circle. He warns that this step would give The Circle too much power and control, and would quickly lead to [[totalitarianism]].

===In music===
* The [[Dead Kennedys]]' song "I Am The Owl" is about government surveillance and [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] of political groups.
* The [[Vienna Teng]] song "Hymn of Acxiom" is about corporate data collection and surveillance.

{{Main|List of films featuring surveillance}}

* The film ''[[Gattaca]]'' portrays a society that uses [[biometric]] surveillance to distinguish between people who are genetically engineered "superior" humans and genetically natural "inferior" humans.
* In the movie ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', the police and government intelligence agencies use [[micro aerial vehicles]] in [[SWAT]] operations and for surveillance purposes.
* [[HBO]]'s crime-drama series ''[[The Sopranos]]'' regularly portrays the FBI's surveillance of the [[DiMeo Crime Family]]. Audio devices they use include "[[Covert listening device|bugs]]" placed in strategic locations (e.g., in "[[I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano]]" and "[[Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood]]") and hidden microphones worn by operatives (e.g., in "[[Rat Pack (The Sopranos)|Rat Pack]]") and informants (e.g., in "[[Funhouse (The Sopranos)|Funhouse]]", "[[Proshai, Livushka]]" and "[[Members Only (The Sopranos)|Members Only]]"). Visual devices include [[hidden cameras|hidden still cameras]] (e.g., in "[[Pax Soprana]]") and video cameras (e.g., in "[[Long Term Parking]]").
* The movie ''[[THX-1138]]'' portrays a society wherein people are drugged with sedatives and antidepressants, and have surveillance cameras watching them everywhere they go.
* The movie ''[[The Lives of Others]]'' portrays the monitoring of [[East Berlin]] by agents of the [[Stasi]], the [[East Germany|GDR]]'s secret police.
* The movie ''[[The Conversation]]'' portrays many methods of [[Eavesdropping|audio surveillance]].
