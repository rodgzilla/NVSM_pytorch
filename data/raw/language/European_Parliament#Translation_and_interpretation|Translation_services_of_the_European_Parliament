The '''European Parliament''' ('''EP''') is the only parliamentary [[Institutions of the European Union|institution of the European Union (EU)]] that is [[direct election|directly elected]] by EU citizens aged 18 or older. Together with the [[Council of the European Union]] (also known as the 'Council'), which should not be confused with the [[European Council]] and the [[Council of Europe]], it exercises the legislative function of the EU. The Parliament is composed of 751 [[Member of the European Parliament|members]] (MEPs), that will become 705 starting from the 2019–2024 legislature (because [[Apportionment in the European Parliament|specific provisions]] adopted about [[Brexit]]), who represent the second-largest democratic electorate in the world (after the [[Parliament of India]]) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world (375&nbsp;million eligible [[Voting|voters]] in 2009).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/07/AR2009060702402.html |title=Conservatives Post Gains In European Elections |author1=Brand, Constant  |author2=Wielaard, Robert |agency=Associated Press |work=The Washington Post |date= 8 June 2009|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Ian Traynor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/07/eu-elections-social-democrats |title=Misery for social democrats as voters take a turn to the right |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 7 June 2009|accessdate=17 August 2010 }}</ref><ref name="18 new MEPs take their seats">{{cite web | url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/content/20120103MUN34829/html/18-new-MEPs-take-their-seats | title=18 new MEPs take their seats | publisher=European Parliament | date=10 January 2012 | accessdate=14 February 2012}}</ref>

It has been directly elected by the European citizens (each EU Member State's national has his state's nationality and EU one consequently) every five years and by [[universal suffrage]] since 1979. However, [[voter turnout]] at [[Elections in the European Union|European Parliament elections]] has fallen consecutively at each election since that date, and has been under 50% since 1999. Voter turnout in 2014 stood at 42.54% of all European voters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Results of the 2014 European elections|url=http://www.results-elections2014.eu/en/turnout.html|publisher=European Parliament}}</ref>

Although the European Parliament has legislative power, as does the Council, they do not formally possess [[legislative initiative]] (it is for the [[European Commission]]), as most [[National parliaments of the European Union|national parliaments]] of European Union member states do.<ref name="Parliament's powers"/><ref name="Pot initiative"/> The Parliament is the "first institution" of the EU (mentioned first in the [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]], having ceremonial precedence over all authority at European level),<ref name="Protocol"/> and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council (except in a few areas where the [[Legislature of the European Union#Special legislative procedures|special legislative procedures]] apply). It likewise has equal control over the [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]]. Finally, the [[European Commission]], the executive body of the EU (it exercises executive powers but no legislative ones), is accountable to Parliament. In particular, Parliament elects the President of the Commission, and approves (or rejects) the appointment of the Commission as a whole. It can subsequently force the Commission as a body to resign by adopting a motion of censure.<ref name="Parliament's powers"/>

The [[President of the European Parliament]] (Parliament's [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]) is [[Antonio Tajani]] ([[European People's Party|EPP]]), elected in January 2017. He presides over a multi-party chamber, the two largest groups being the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|Group of the European People's Party]] (EPP) and the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]] (S&D). The last union-wide elections were the [[European Parliament election, 2014|2014 elections]].

The European Parliament has three places of work&nbsp;– [[Brussels]] (Belgium), [[Luxembourg City|the city of Luxembourg]] (Luxembourg) and [[Strasbourg]] (France).
Luxembourg is home to the administrative offices (the "General Secretariat"). Meetings of the whole Parliament ("plenary sessions") take place in Strasbourg and in Brussels. Committee meetings are held in Brussels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/european-parliament/index_en.htm |title=European Parliament |publisher=Europa |date=19 April 2010 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}</ref><ref name="Consolidated Treaty">{{cite web|title = Consolidated versions of the treaty on European Union and of the treaty establishing the European Community|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Eur-lex]]|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =12 June 2007 }}</ref>

==History==
{{Further|History of the European Union}}
The Parliament, like the other institutions, was not designed in its current form when it first met on 10 September 1952. One of the oldest common institutions, it began as the ''Common Assembly'' of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC). It was a consultative assembly of 78 appointed parliamentarians [[dual mandate|drawn]] from the national parliaments of member states, having no legislative powers.<ref name="ENA History">{{cite web|title = European Parliament|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/european_parliament-en-ad6a0d57-08ef-427d-a715-f6e3bfaf775a.html|accessdate =19 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = EPP-ED Chronology—1951–1960|publisher=[[European People's Party]]|url=http://www.epp-ed.eu/group/en/chronology02.asp|accessdate =5 July 2007}}</ref> The change since its foundation was highlighted by Professor David Farrell<!--don't link, not a football player--> of the [[University of Manchester]]: "For much of its life, the European Parliament could have been justly labelled a 'multi-lingual talking shop'."<ref name="Farrell Powerful">{{cite web|title = Professor Farrell: "The EP is now one of the most powerful legislatures in the world"|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20070615IPR07837|date=18 June 2007|accessdate =5 July 2007}}</ref>

Its development since its foundation shows how the [[European Union]]'s structures have evolved without a clear "master plan". Some, such as Tom Reid<!--Do not link, Wikipedia Tom Reid is an ice hockey player--> of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', said of the union: "nobody would have deliberately designed a government as complex and as redundant as the EU".<ref>{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Tom|title=The United States of Europe|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|year=2004|location=London|page=272|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=0-14-102317-1}}</ref> Even the Parliament's [[Location of European Union institutions#European Parliament|two seats]], which have switched several times, are a result of various agreements or lack of agreements. Although most [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s would prefer to be based just in Brussels, at [[John Major]]'s 1992 Edinburgh [[European Council|summit]], France engineered a treaty amendment to maintain Parliament's plenary seat permanently at Strasbourg.<ref name="ENA History"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.european-council.europa.eu/media/854346/1992_december_-_edinburgh__eng_.pdf|title=The European Council - Consilium|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912031712/http://www.european-council.europa.eu/media/854346/1992_december_-_edinburgh__eng_.pdf|archivedate=12 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Consultative assembly===
The body was not mentioned in the original [[Schuman Declaration]]. It was assumed or hoped that difficulties with the British would be resolved to allow the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Council of Europe's Assembly]] to perform the task. A separate Assembly was introduced during negotiations on the Treaty as an institution which would counterbalance and monitor the [[Executive (government)|executive]] while providing democratic legitimacy.<ref name="ENA History"/> The wording of the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|ECSC Treaty]] demonstrated the leaders' desire for more than a normal consultative assembly by using the term "representatives of the people" and allowed for direct election. Its early importance was highlighted when the Assembly was given the task of drawing up the draft treaty to establish a [[European Political Community]]. By this document, the Ad Hoc Assembly was established on 13 September 1952<ref name="AEIpolitical_union_draft_treaty_1">{{cite web|title =Ad Hoc Assembly, Information and Official Documents of the Constitutional Committee, October&nbsp;1952 to April&nbsp;1953|publisher=[[Archive of European Integration]]|year=1953|url=http://aei.pitt.edu/991/01/political_union_draft_treaty_1.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate =29 October 2008}}</ref> with extra members, but after the failure of the proposed [[European Defence Community]] the project was dropped.<ref name="ENA composition">{{cite web|title = Composition of the European Parliament|publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/political_composition_of_the_european_parliament_2004-en-13cdefb7-829e-4567-b709-6057d1fcb990.html |accessdate =19 April 2013}}</ref> [[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F023908-0002, Straßburg, Tagung des Europarates.jpg|thumb|left|Session of the Council of Europe's Assembly in the former [[Palace of Europe|House of Europe]] in Strasbourg in January 1967. [[Willy Brandt]], [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|West German minister for Foreign Affairs]], is speaking.]]

Despite this, the [[European Economic Community]] and [[Euratom]] were established in 1958 by the [[Treaty of Rome|Treaties of Rome]]. The Common Assembly was shared by all three communities (which had separate executives) and it renamed itself the ''European Parliamentary Assembly''.<ref name="ENA History"/> The first meeting was held on 19 March 1958 having been set up in Luxembourg, it elected Schuman as its president and on 13 May it rearranged itself to sit according to political ideology rather than nationality.<ref name="1958 history">{{cite web|title = 1945–1959 The beginnings of cooperation: 1958|publisher = European Parliament|url = http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/1945-1959/1958/index_en.htm|accessdate = 20 September 2012|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121022231815/http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/1945-1959/1958/index_en.htm|archivedate = 22 October 2012|df = dmy-all}}</ref> This is seen as the birth of the modern European Parliament, with Parliament's 50 years celebrations being held in March 2008 rather than 2002.<ref name="50 years">{{cite web|title =50th anniversary of the European Parliament celebrated in Strasbourg|publisher=European Parliament|date=12 March 2008|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+IM-PRESS+20080311IPR23707+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN |accessdate =6 April 2010}}</ref>

The three communities [[Merger Treaty|merged]] their remaining organs as the [[European Communities]] in 1967, and the body's name was changed to the current "European Parliament" in 1962.<ref name="ENA History"/> In 1970 the Parliament was granted power over areas of the [[Budget of the European Union|Communities' budget]], which were expanded to the whole budget in 1975.<ref name="ENA Budget">{{cite web|title = Power of the purse of the European Parliament|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/power_of_the_purse_of_the_european_parliament-en-f0eebff2-b760-467d-951c-7ef14a350199.html |accessdate =19 April 2013}}</ref> Under the Rome Treaties, the Parliament should have become elected. However, the Council was required to agree a uniform voting system beforehand, which it failed to do. The Parliament threatened to take the Council to the [[European Court of Justice]]; this led to a compromise whereby the Council would agree to elections, but the issue of voting systems would be put off until a later date.<ref name="Hoskyns">{{cite book| last = Hoskyns | first = Catherine |author2=Michael Newman | title = Democratizing the European Union: Issues for the twenty-first Century (Perspectives on Democratization) | publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-7190-5666-6 }}</ref>

===Elected Parliament===
[[File:Flag of the European Parliament 1973-1983.svg|thumb|left|The emblem of Parliament until 1983]]
[[File:Europa Parlament 1985.jpg|thumb|left|Session April 1985]]
In 1979, its members were [[Elections in the European Union|directly elected]] for the [[European Parliament election, 1979|first time]]. This sets it apart from similar institutions such as those of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] or [[Pan-African Parliament]] which are appointed.<ref name="ENA History"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Framework|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=/AboutUs/APCE_framework.htm|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|accessdate=5 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609093551/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=%2FAboutUs%2FAPCE_framework.htm|archivedate=9 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title =Overview of the Pan-African Parliament|publisher =[[Pan-African Parliament]]|url =http://www.pan-africanparliament.org/AboutPAP_Overview.aspx|accessdate =5 July 2007|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070929025936/http://www.pan-africanparliament.org/AboutPAP_Overview.aspx|archivedate =29 September 2007|df =dmy-all}}</ref> After that first election, the parliament held its first session on 11 July 1979, electing [[Simone Veil]] MEP as its president. Veil was also the first female president of the Parliament since it was formed as the Common Assembly.

As an elected body, the Parliament began to draft proposals addressing the functioning of the EU. For example, in 1984, inspired by its previous work on the Political Community, it drafted the "draft Treaty establishing the European Union" (also known as the 'Spinelli Plan' after its rapporteur [[Altiero Spinelli]] MEP). Although it was not adopted, many ideas were later implemented by other treaties.<ref name="ENA TEU">{{cite web|title = The European Parliament's proposals|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_european_parliament_s_proposals-en-9169f4c4-6aa2-40d7-af99-9004fb85332c.html |accessdate =19 April 2013}}</ref> Furthermore, the Parliament began holding votes on proposed [[President of the European Commission|Commission Presidents]] from the 1980s, before it was given any formal right to veto.<ref name="Commission Appointment">{{cite web|last = European Parliament Website|title = Oversight over the Commission and Council|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+PRESS+BI-20041022-1+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|accessdate =1 July 2007 }}</ref>

Since it became an elected body, the membership of the European Parliament has simply expanded whenever new nations have joined (the membership was also adjusted upwards in 1994 after [[German reunification]]). Following this, the [[Treaty of Nice]] imposed a cap on the number of members to be elected, 732.<ref name="ENA History"/> [[File:Pleniere.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palace of Europe]], Parliament's Strasbourg hemicycle until 1999]]



Like the other institutions, the Parliament's [[Seat (legal entity)|seat]] was not yet fixed. The provisional arrangements placed Parliament in [[Strasbourg]], while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing to be closer to these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the [[European Council]] in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels. This two-seat arrangement was contested by the Parliament, but was later enshrined in the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]]. To this day the [[Location of European Union institutions|institution's locations]] are a source of contention.<ref name="ENA seats">{{cite web|title=The seats of the institutions of the European Union|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_seats_of_the_institutions_of_the_european_union-en-cd672879-aeb1-4cad-a0c1-9e4ff75ff660.html|publisher=CVCE|accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref>

The Parliament gained more powers from successive treaties, namely through the extension of the [[ordinary legislative procedure]] (then called the codecision procedure),<ref name="ENA legis">{{cite web|title=Power to legislate of the European Parliament|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/power_to_legislate_of_the_european_parliament-en-4f35fdb4-323e-49a0-a138-5b11d701d9a3.html|publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]]|accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref> and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the [[Santer Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|last = Topan|first=Angelina|title = The resignation of the Santer-Commission: the impact of 'trust' and 'reputation' |date=30 September 2002|publisher=European Integration Online Papers|url=http://eiop.or.at/eiop/pdf/2002-014.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =19 April 2013}}</ref> The Parliament had refused to approve the [[Budget of the European Union|Community budget]] over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the Commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, in the face of an impending censure from the Parliament.<ref name="Ringe"/>

===Parliament pressure on the Commission===
[[File:José Manuel Barroso MEDEF FULL.jpg|thumb|left|In 2004, Parliament forced [[President Barroso]] to change his proposed Commission team.]]
In 2004, following the largest trans-national election in history, despite the European Council choosing a President from the largest political group (the EPP), the Parliament again exerted pressure on the Commission. During the Parliament's hearings of the proposed [[European Commissioner|Commissioners]] MEPs raised doubts about some nominees with the [[Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs|Civil Liberties committee]] rejecting [[Rocco Buttiglione]] from the post of [[European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security|Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security]] over his views on homosexuality. That was the first time the Parliament had ever voted against an incoming Commissioner and despite Barroso's insistence upon Buttiglione the Parliament forced Buttiglione to be withdrawn. A number of other Commissioners also had to be withdrawn or reassigned before Parliament allowed the [[Barroso Commission]] to take office.<ref name="IHT Butt"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Tobais|first=Troll|title =We have to democratise procedures|date=2 November 2004|publisher=Café Babel|url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=2620|accessdate =12 June 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051129143940/http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=2620| archivedate = 29 November 2005}}</ref>

[[File:Rocco Buttiglione 2001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Rocco Buttiglione]] was the first Commission designate to be voted down by Parliament]]
Along with the extension of the ordinary legislative procedure, the Parliament's democratic mandate has given it greater control over legislation against the other institutions. In voting on the [[Bolkestein directive]] in 2006, the Parliament voted by a large majority for over 400 amendments that changed the fundamental principle of the law. The ''[[Financial Times]]'' described it in the following terms:<ref name="FT CIO">{{cite web|title = How the European parliament got serious|date=23 February 2006|work=Financial Times |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/56b6d760-a412-11da-83cc-0000779e2340.html|accessdate =12 June 2007 }}</ref>

In 2007, for the first time, Justice Commissioner [[Franco Frattini]] included Parliament in talks on the second [[Schengen Information System]] even though MEPs only needed to be consulted on parts of the package.

The [[Lisbon Treaty]] finally came into force on 1 December 2009, granting Parliament powers over the entire [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]], making Parliament's [[Ordinary legislative procedure|legislative powers]] equal to the Council's in nearly all areas and linking the appointment of the [[President of the European Commission|Commission President]] to Parliament's own elections.<ref name="Constitution info"/> Despite some calls for the parties to put forward candidates beforehand, only the [[European People's Party|EPP]] (which had re-secured their position as largest party) had one in re-endorsing Barroso.<ref name="Epin">{{cite web|last=Hughes |first=Kirsty |title=Nearing Compromise as Convention goes into Final Week? |publisher=EPIN |url=http://www.epin.org/pdf/comment_Hughes2_june03.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=30 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227034911/http://www.epin.org/pdf/comment_Hughes2_june03.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Barroso gained the support of the European Council for a second term and secured majority support from the Parliament in September 2009. Parliament voted 382 votes in favour and 219 votes against (117 abstentions ) with support of the [[European People's Party]], [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] and the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]].<ref name="B2V">{{cite web|title=MEPs elect Barroso to a second term as Commission President|publisher=European Parliament|date=16 September 2009|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-60584-257-09-38-901-20090911IPR60583-14-09-2009-2009-false/default_en.htm|accessdate=28 June 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923032006/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-60584-257-09-38-901-20090911IPR60583-14-09-2009-2009-false/default_en.htm|archivedate=23 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The liberals gave support after Barroso gave them a number of concessions; the liberals previously joined the socialists' call for a delayed vote (the [[European People's Party|EPP]] had wanted to approve Barroso in July of that year).<ref name="B2C">{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Simon|title = A second term&nbsp;– but at what price?|publisher=[[European Voice]]|date=17 September 2009|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/a-second-term-–-but-at-what-price-/65887.aspx|accessdate =28 June 2007 }}</ref>

Once Barroso put forward the candidates for his next Commission, another opportunity to gain concessions arose. Bulgarian nominee [[Rumiana Jeleva]] was forced to step down by Parliament due to concerns over her experience and financial interests. She only had the support of the [[European People's Party|EPP]] which began to retaliate on left wing candidates before Jeleva gave in and was replaced (setting back the final vote further).<ref name="RJ">{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Simon|title = How Jeleva was forced out|publisher=[[European Voice]]|date=21 January 2010|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/how-jeleva-was-forced-out/66933.aspx|accessdate =28 June 2007 }}</ref>

Before the final vote, Parliament demanded a number of concessions as part of a future working agreement under the new Lisbon Treaty. The deal includes that Parliament's President will attend high level Commission meetings. Parliament will have a seat in the EU's Commission-led international negotiations and have a right to information on agreements. However, Parliament secured only an observer seat. Parliament also did not secure a say over the appointment of [[List of diplomatic missions of the European Union|delegation]] heads and [[European Union Special Representative|special representatives]] for foreign policy. Although they will appear before parliament after they have been appointed by the [[High Representative]]. One major internal power was that Parliament wanted a pledge from the Commission that it would put forward legislation when parliament requests. Barroso considered this an infringement on the Commission's powers but did agree to respond within three months. Most requests are already responded to positively.<ref name="B2A">{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Simon|title =MEPs agree working relations with Barroso|publisher=[[European Voice]]|date=28 January 2010|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/meps-agree-working-relations-with-barroso/66982.aspx|accessdate =28 June 2007 }}</ref>

During the setting up of the [[European External Action Service]] (EEAS), Parliament used its control over the EU budget to influence the shape of the EEAS. MEPs had aimed at getting greater oversight over the EEAS by linking it to the Commission and having political deputies to the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]]. MEPs didn't manage to get everything they demanded. However, they got broader financial control over the new body.<ref name="EEAS"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Vogel|first=Toby|title =Backing of MEPs paves way for launch of diplomatic corps|publisher=EurActiv|date=21 October 2010|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/backing-of-meps-paves-way-for-launch-of-diplomatic-corps/69215.aspx|accessdate =19 September 2011 }}</ref>
In January 2019, Conservative MEPs supported proposals to boost opportunities for women and tackle sexual harassment in the European Parliament.

==Powers and functions==
[[File:European Parliament Strasbourg Hemicycle - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Parliament's hemicycle ([[debating chamber]]) during a plenary session in Strasbourg.]]
The Parliament and Council have been compared to the two [[Chambers of parliament|chambers]] of a [[bicameral]] legislature.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bicameral Traits At EU Level |url=https://epthinktank.eu/2013/01/25/bicameral-traits-at-eu-level/|date=25 January 2013|accessdate=29 April 2016|publisher=European Parliamentary Research Service|quote=A bicameral structure for the European Union has been proposed on numerous occasions. A frequent suggestion, and one designed to address the EU’s alleged democratic deficit, is for a second chamber composed of national parliamentarians alongside the European Parliament. However, it is also argued that the EU already has a second chamber, the Council of the EU – representing Europe’s nations, with the first chamber, the EP, representing its citizens. In regard to this latter view there are differing opinions.}}</ref> However, there are some differences from [[National parliaments of the European Union|national legislatures]]; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of [[legislative initiative]] (except for the fact that the Council has the power in some [[Intergovernmentalism#A theory of regional integration|intergovernmental]] matters). In [[European Community|Community matters]], this is a power uniquely reserved for the [[European Commission]] (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] before anything can become law.<ref>{{cite web|title = Fact Sheets 1.3.8 The Commission|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/1_3_8_en.htm|accessdate =14 June 2007 }}</ref> The value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law.<ref name="Kreppel">{{cite book|first= Amie|last= Kreppel |editor1-first=Anand |editor1-last=Menon |editor2-first=Martin A. |editor2-last=Schain |title= Comparative Federalism:The European Union and the United States in Comparative Perspective: The European Union and the United States in Comparative Perspective|pages=245–274|chapter= Understanding the European Parliament from a Federalist Perspective: The Legislatures of the USA and EU Compared|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006}}</ref> Yet it has been argued by former Parliament president [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]] that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a ''de facto'' right of legislative initiative.<ref name="Pot initiative">{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Matt|date=24 June 2008|title=Pöttering defends parliament's role at EU summits|publisher=The Parliament Magazine|url=http://www.theparliament.com/policy-focus/foreign-affairs/foreign-affairs-article/newsarticle/poettering-defends-parliaments-role-at-eu-summits/|accessdate=25 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524113601/http://www.theparliament.com/policy-focus/foreign-affairs/foreign-affairs-article/newsarticle/poettering-defends-parliaments-role-at-eu-summits/|archivedate=24 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The Parliament also has a great deal of indirect influence, through [[European Union law#Legislation|non-binding resolutions]] and [[Committees of the European Parliament|committee hearings]], as a "pan-European [[soapbox]]" with the ear of [[Brussels and the European Union#Lobbyists and journalists|thousands of Brussels-based journalists]]. There is also an indirect effect on [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|foreign policy]]; the Parliament must approve all development grants, including those overseas. For example, the support for [[Iraq War|post-war Iraq]] reconstruction, or incentives for the cessation of [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iranian nuclear development]], must be supported by the Parliament. Parliamentary support was also required for the [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] passenger data-sharing deal with the United States.<ref name="Rockwell">{{cite book | last = Schnabel | first = Rockwell |author2=Francis Rocca | title = The Next Superpower?: the Rise of Europe and its Challenge to the United States | publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] Publishers | year = 2005 | location = Oxford | page = 111 | isbn = 978-0-7425-4548-9 }}</ref> Finally, Parliament holds a non-binding vote on new EU treaties but cannot veto it. However, when Parliament threatened to vote down the Nice Treaty, the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Belgian]] and [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliaments]] said they would veto the treaty on the European Parliament's behalf.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirk|first=Lizabeth|date=11 January 2001|title = No guarantee EP will back Treaty of Nice|publisher=EU Observer|url=http://euobserver.com/9/1249|accessdate =19 September 2011 }}</ref>

===Legislative procedure===
With each new treaty, the powers of the Parliament, in terms of its role in the [[Ordinary legislative procedure|Union's legislative procedures]], have expanded. The procedure which has slowly become dominant is the "[[ordinary legislative procedure]]" (previously named "codecision procedure"), which provides an equal footing between Parliament and Council. In particular, under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council which can only become law if both agree on a text, which they do (or not) through successive readings up to a maximum of three. In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a "common position". That position may either be approved by Parliament,  or it may reject the text by an [[absolute majority]], causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a "Conciliation Committee" is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority.<ref name="Parliament's powers">{{cite web|title = Parliament's powers and procedures|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=46|accessdate =12 June 2007}}</ref><ref name="decision making">{{cite web|title=Decision-making in the European Union|work=|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=18 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040316/http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This is also aided by Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the [[Bolkestein directive]] in 2006.<ref name="FT CIO"/>

The few other areas that operate the ''special legislative procedures'' are justice and home affairs, budget and taxation, and certain aspects of other policy areas, such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone.<ref name="lisbon explain"/> The procedure also depends upon which type of [[European Union law#Legislation|institutional act]] is being used.<ref name="Parliament's powers"/> The strongest act is a [[Regulation (European Union)|regulation]], an [[Act of Parliament|act]] or [[Statutory law|law]] which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] which bind member states to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A [[European Union decision|decision]] is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue [[European Union recommendation|recommendations and opinions]] which are merely non-binding, declarations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Community legal instruments |work= |publisher=European Parliament |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/community_legal_instruments_en.htm |doi= |accessdate=18 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708114002/http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/community_legal_instruments_en.htm |archivedate=8 July 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> There is a further document which does not follow normal procedures, this is a "written declaration" which is similar to an [[early day motion]] used in the [[Westminster system]]. It is a document proposed by up to five MEPs on a matter within the EU's activities used to launch a debate on that subject. Having been posted outside the entrance to the hemicycle, members can sign the declaration and if a majority do so it is forwarded to the President and announced to the plenary before being forwarded to the other institutions and formally noted in the minutes.<ref name="EP WD">{{cite web|title = Written declarations|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/plenary/writtenDecl.do|accessdate =1 November 2007}}</ref>

===Budget===
The legislative branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority with powers gained through the [[Budgetary treaties of the European Communities|Budgetary Treaties]] of the 1970s and the [[Lisbon Treaty]]. The [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]] is subject to a form of the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (before 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. If the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively.<ref name="lisbon explain">{{cite web|title = Explaining the Treaty of Lisbon|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/531|accessdate =4 December 2009 }}</ref>

The Parliament is also responsible for discharging the implementation of previous budgets based on the annual report of the [[European Court of Auditors]]. It has refused to approve the budget only twice, in 1984 and in 1998. On the latter occasion it led to the resignation of the [[Santer Commission]]; highlighting how the budgetary power gives Parliament a great deal of power over the Commission.<ref name="Hoskyns"/><ref name="Ringe"/><ref name="budget background">{{cite web | title=Budgetary control: 1996 discharge raises issue of confidence in the Commission  | publisher=European Parliament| year=1999  | url =http://www.europarl.europa.eu/election/bilan/en/pf1901en.htm | accessdate =15 October 2007 }}</ref> Parliament also makes extensive use of its budgetary, and other powers, elsewhere; for example in the setting up of the [[European External Action Service]], Parliament has a de facto veto over its design as it has to approve the budgetary and staff changes.<ref name="EEAS">{{cite web|first=Honor|last=Mahoney|title = Member states to signal broad backing for diplomatic service blueprint|publisher=[[EU Observer]]|url=http://euobserver.com/24/29916|date=23 April 2010|accessdate =2 May 2010 }}</ref>

===Control of the executive===
The [[President of the European Commission]] is proposed by the European Council on the basis of the European elections to Parliament.<ref name="Constitution info">{{cite web|title=The Union's institutions: The European Parliament|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/parliament_en.htm|accessdate=28 June 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201174755/http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/parliament_en.htm|archivedate=1 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> That proposal has to be approved by the Parliament (by a simple majority) who "elect" the President according to the treaties. Following the approval of the Commission President, the members of the Commission are proposed by the President in accord with the member states. Each Commissioner comes before a relevant parliamentary committee hearing covering the proposed portfolio. They are then, as a body, approved or rejected by the Parliament.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|title = Background Information: Election of the European Commission|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+PRESS+BI-20041022-1+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|accessdate =1 July 2007 }}</ref><ref name="Commission Oversight">{{cite web|title = Oversight over the Commission and Council|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=9&language=EN|accessdate =12 June 2007 }}</ref>

In practice, the Parliament has never voted against a President or his Commission, but it did seem likely when the Barroso Commission was put forward. The resulting pressure forced the proposal to be withdrawn and changed to be more acceptable to parliament.<ref name="IHT Butt">{{cite web|last =Bowley|first=Graham|title =Buttiglione affair highlights evolving role of Parliament : Questions arise on democracy at the EU|work=International Herald Tribune |date=18 October 2004|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/18/brussels_ed3_.php|accessdate =1 July 2007}}</ref> That pressure was seen as an important sign by some of the evolving nature of the Parliament and its ability to make the Commission accountable, rather than being a rubber stamp for candidates. Furthermore, in voting on the Commission, MEPs also voted along party lines, rather than national lines, despite frequent pressure from national governments on their MEPs. This cohesion and willingness to use the Parliament's power ensured greater attention from national leaders, other institutions and the public—who previously gave the lowest ever turnout for the Parliament's elections.<ref>{{cite web |last=Murray |first=Alasdair |title=Three cheers for EU democracy |publisher=[[Open Europe]] |year=2004 |url=http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/39_murray.html |accessdate=7 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610003606/http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/39_murray.html |archivedate=10 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>

The Parliament also has the power to censure the Commission if they have a two-thirds majority which will force the resignation of the entire Commission from office. As with approval, this power has never been used but it was threatened to the [[Santer Commission]], who subsequently [[Santer Commission#Resignation|resigned of their own accord]]. There are a few other controls, such as: the requirement of Commission to submit reports to the Parliament and answer questions from MEPs; the requirement of the President-in-office of the Council to present its programme at the start of their [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency]]; the obligation on the President of the [[European Council]] to report to Parliament after each of its meetings; the right of MEPs to make requests for legislation and policy to the Commission; and the right to question members of those institutions (e.g. "Commission [[Question Time]]" every Tuesday).<ref name="Commission Appointment"/><ref name="Commission Oversight"/> At present, MEPs may ask a question on any topic whatsoever, but in July 2008 MEPs voted to limit questions to those within the EU's mandate and ban offensive or personal questions.<ref name="EUO rise">{{cite web|last=Mahony|first=Honor|title=New rules to make it harder for MEPs to form political groups|url=http://euobserver.com/9/26468|date=9 July 2008|work=International Herald Tribune |accessdate=10 July 2008}}</ref>

===Supervisory powers===
The Parliament also has other powers of general supervision, mainly granted by the [[Maastricht Treaty]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Maastricht Treaty 15 years on: birth of the "European Union"|publisher=European Parliament|date=7 February 2007|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/008-2784-036-02-06-901-20070206STO02783-2007-05-02-2007/default_en.htm|accessdate=6 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209191039/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/008-2784-036-02-06-901-20070206STO02783-2007-05-02-2007/default_en.htm|archivedate=9 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Parliament has the power to set up a Committee of Inquiry, for example over mad cow disease or CIA detention flights—the former led to the creation of the [[European Medicines Agency|European veterinary agency]]. The Parliament can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to [[Court of Justice of the European Communities|court]] if they break EU law or treaties.<ref name="supervisory">{{cite web|title = Supervisory power|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=8&language=EN|accessdate =12 June 2007 }}</ref> Furthermore, it has powers over the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors<ref>{{cite web|title =Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.

The [[List of Presidents of the European Central Bank|ECB president]] is also obliged to present an annual report to the parliament.<ref name="supervisory"/>

The [[European Ombudsman]] is elected by the Parliament, who deals with public complaints against all institutions.<ref name="supervisory"/> [[European Citizens' Initiative|Petitions]] can also be brought forward by any [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizen]] on a matter within the EU's sphere of activities. The [[Committee on Petitions]] hears cases, some 1500 each year, sometimes presented by the citizen themselves at the Parliament. While the Parliament attempts to resolve the issue as a mediator they do resort to legal proceedings if it is necessary to resolve the citizens dispute.<ref name="petitions">{{cite news|last=Rickards|first=Mark|title = MEPs get taste of people power|publisher=BBC News|date=3 November 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7075573.stm|accessdate =3 November 2007 }}</ref>

==Members==
{{National apportionment of MEPs}}
{{Main|Member of the European Parliament}}
The [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]] are known in English as Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). They are elected every five years by [[universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]] and sit according to political allegiance; about a third are women. Before 1979 they were appointed by their national parliaments.<ref name="ENA composition"/><ref name="EP Members">{{cite web|title = Members|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=45&pageRank=3 |accessdate =27 October 2007}}</ref> In 2017, an estimated 17 MEPs were not white.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ginger |last=Hervey |title = When Britain exits the EU, its diversity departs too |publisher=politico.eu |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-diversity-exits-the-eu-brussels/amp/ |date=12 November 2017 |accessdate =24 October 2018}}</ref> Of these, three were black; if the numbers were proportionate to the EU population, then 22 would be black.<ref>{{cite news|title = The EU is too white – and Brexit likely to make it worse, MEPs and staff say |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/29/eu-is-too-white-brexit-likely-to-make-it-worse |publisher=The Guardian |date=29 August 2018 |first=Jennifer |last=Rankin |accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref>

Under the Lisbon Treaty, [[Apportionment in the European Parliament|seats are allocated]] to each state according to population and the maximum number of members is set at 751 (however, as the President cannot vote while in the chair there will only be 750 voting members at any one time).<ref name="EUO Lisbon">{{cite web|last=Goldirova|first=Renata|title =EU agrees new 'Treaty of Lisbon'|date=19 October 2007|publisher=EU Observer|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25001|accessdate =19 November 2007}}</ref>

The seats are distributed according to "[[degressive proportionality]]", i.e., the larger the state, the more citizens are represented per MEP. As a result, Maltese and Luxembourgish voters have roughly 10x more influence per voter than citizens of the six large countries.

{{As of|2014}}, Germany (80.9 million inhabitants) has 96 seats (previously 99 seats), i.e. one seat for 843,000 inhabitants. Malta (0.4 million inhabitants) has 6 seats, i.e. one seat for 70,000 inhabitants.

The new system implemented under the Lisbon Treaty, including revising the seating well before elections, was intended to avoid political [[horse trading (political)|horse trading]] when the allocations have to be revised to reflect demographic changes.<ref>{{cite web|quote=In approving the European Council's draft decision, the committee asks that the proposed distribution be revised, well in advance of the beginning of the 2014-2019 legislative term, so as to set up an objective and fair system for allocating the seats in the EP, in order take account of demographic changes and 'avoid the traditional political horse-trading between Member States'. |title = Distribution of EP seats: Constitutional Affairs Committee approvals proposal|date=4 October 2007|publisher=European Parliament|url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+IM-PRESS+20070927BRI10862+ITEM-002-EN+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN |accessdate =3 November 2018}}</ref>

Pursuant to this apportionment, the [[European Parliament constituency|constituencies]] are formed. In six EU member states (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom), the national territory is divided into a number of constituencies. In the remaining member states, the whole country forms a single constituency. All member states hold elections to the European Parliament using various forms of [[proportional representation]].

===Transitional arrangements===
Due to the delay in ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, the [[7th European Parliament|seventh parliament]] was elected under the lower Nice Treaty cap. A [[Treaties of the European Union#Transitional provisions protocol|small scale treaty amendment]] was ratified on 29 November 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=IM-PRESS&reference=20100223BKG69359&language=EN | title=Ratification of Parliament's 18 additional MEPs completed | publisher=European Parliament | date=29 November 2011 | accessdate=14 February 2012}}</ref> This amendment brought in transitional provisions to allow the 18 additional MEPs created under the Lisbon Treaty to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election.<ref>{{cite web|title = Agreement details: Protocol amending the Protocol on Transitional Provisions annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Deposited with the Government of the Italian Republic)|publisher=Council of the European Union|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/App/accords/Default.aspx?command=details&id=297&lang=EN&aid=2010057&doclang=EN|accessdate =4 October 2011}}</ref> Under the Lisbon Treaty reforms, Germany was the only state to lose members from 99 to 96.

===Salaries and expenses===
Before 2009, members received the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of €8,484.05 each in 2016, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs are entitled to a pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on actual cost.<ref>{{cite web|title = About MEPs|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/about-meps.html|accessdate=13 January 2019}}</ref> Besides their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and [[Diplomatic immunity|immunities]]. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting [[Diplomat|foreign representative]]s. When in their own state, they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have immunity from [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]] and [[Criminal procedure|legal proceedings]]. However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.<ref name="LEX Prot">{{cite web|title = 7.

===Political groups===
{{Main|Political groups of the European Parliament}}
MEPs in Parliament are organised into eight different [[parliamentary group]]s, including thirty non-attached members known as ''[[non-inscrits]]''. The two largest groups are the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists & Democrats]] (S&D). These two groups have dominated the Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats between them. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|last=Kreppel |first=Amie |title=The European Parliament and Supranational Party System |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2002 |url=http://193.60.94.203/97805218/06251/sample/9780521806251ws.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=12 June 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> As a result of being broad alliances of national parties, European group parties are very decentralised and hence have more in common with parties in federal states like Germany or the United States than unitary states like the majority of the EU states.<ref name="Kreppel"/> Nevertheless, the European groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title="What to expect in the 2009–14 European Parliament": Analysis from a leading EU expert|publisher=European Parliament website|year=2009|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/008-60547-292-10-43-901-20090911STO60546-2009-19-10-2009/default_en.htm|accessdate=17 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210105843/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/008-60547-292-10-43-901-20090911STO60546-2009-19-10-2009/default_en.htm|archivedate=10 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Cohesion rates|publisher=Vote Watch|year=2010|url=http://www.votewatch.eu/cx_european_party_groups.php|accessdate =17 February 2010 }}</ref>

Groups are often based on a single [[European political party]] such as the [[Party of European Socialists|socialist group]] (before 2009). However, they can, like the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe|liberal group]], include more than one European party as well as national parties and independents.<ref>{{cite web|title=Party Politics in the EU |publisher=civitas.org.uk |url=http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/download/CIT.3.EU%20Political%20Parties.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=12 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019072737/http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/download/CIT.3.EU%20Political%20Parties.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> For a group to be recognised, it needs 25 MEPs from seven different countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=European Parliament increases threshold to form a political group |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/009-33698-189-07-28-901-20080708IPR33697-07-07-2008-2008-false/default_en.htm |date=9 July 2008 |publisher=European Parliament |accessdate=10 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802225935/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/009-33698-189-07-28-901-20080708IPR33697-07-07-2008-2008-false/default_en.htm |archivedate=2 August 2008 }}</ref> Once recognised, groups receive financial subsidies from the parliament and guaranteed seats on committees, creating an incentive for the formation of groups.

===Grand coalition===
Given that the Parliament does not form the government in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than [[majority rule]] of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much of its life it has been dominated by a [[grand coalition]] of the [[European People's Party]] and the [[Party of European Socialists]]. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities.<ref>{{cite web|last=Settembri |first=Pierpaolo |title=Is the European Parliament competitive or consensual&nbsp;...

Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the [[Santer Commission#Budget controversy|resignation of the Santer Commission]].<ref name = "Ringe"/>

When the initial allegations against the Commission emerged, they were directed primarily against [[Édith Cresson]] and [[Manuel Marín]], both socialist members. When the parliament was considering refusing to discharge the [[Budget of the European Union|Community budget]], President [[Jacques Santer]] stated that a no vote would be tantamount to a [[vote of no confidence]]. The Socialist group supported the Commission and saw the issue as an attempt by the EPP to discredit their party ahead of the 1999 elections. Socialist leader, [[Pauline Green]] MEP, attempted a vote of confidence and the EPP put forward counter motions. During this period the two parties took on similar roles to a government-[[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] dynamic, with the Socialists supporting the executive and EPP renouncing its previous coalition support and voting it down.<ref name="Ringe"/> Politicisation such as this has been increasing, in 2007 Simon Hix of the [[London School of Economics]] noted that:<ref name="Farrell Powerful"/>
{{quote|Our work also shows that politics in the European Parliament is becoming increasingly based around party and ideology. Voting is increasingly split along left-right lines, and the cohesion of the party groups has risen dramatically, particularly in the fourth and fifth parliaments. So there are likely to be policy implications here too.}}

During the fifth term, 1999 to 2004, there was a break in the grand coalition resulting in a centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties.<ref name="Watson interview">{{cite web|title=Interview: Graham Watson, leader of group of Liberal Democrat MEPs |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/elections/interview-graham-watson-leader-group-liberal-democrat-meps/article-128543 |publisher=Euractiv |date=15 June 2004 |accessdate=1 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814000107/http://www.euractiv.com/en/elections/interview-graham-watson-leader-group-liberal-democrat-meps/article-128543 |archivedate=14 August 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> This was reflected in the Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the ELDR, rather than the EPP and Socialists.<ref>{{cite news|title = European Parliament elects new president |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/398892.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=20 July 1999|accessdate=1 November 2007}}</ref> In the following term the liberal group grew to hold 88 seats, the largest number of seats held by any third party in Parliament.<ref name="ALDE formed">{{cite web|title=The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is born |date=14 July 2004 |publisher=Graham Watson MEP website |url=http://www.grahamwatsonmep.org/news/000017/the_alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe_is_born.html |accessdate=7 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205090940/http://www.grahamwatsonmep.org/news/000017/the_alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe_is_born.html |archivedate=5 December 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Elections===
{{Main|Elections to the European Parliament}}
{{EP election results graph (percentage)}}

Elections have taken place, directly in every member state, every five years since 1979. {{As of|2014}} there have been eight elections. When a nation joins mid-term, a by-election will be held to elect their representatives. This has happened six times, most recently when Croatia joined in 2013. Elections take place across four days according to local custom and, apart from having to be proportional, the [[electoral system]] is chosen by the member state.<ref>The motto "[[Unity in diversity]]" could not be better confirmed in the European election law: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Le incompatibilità (per ora rinviate per motivi di salute) che bloccano l'ingresso al Parlamento europeo|journal= Diritto&Giustizia edizione online |date=2003| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89371998}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> This includes allocation of [[European Parliament constituency|sub-national constituencies]]; while most members have a national list, some, like the UK and France, divide their allocation between regions. Seats are allocated to member states according to their population, since 2014 with no state having more than 96, but no fewer than 6, to maintain proportionality.<ref>{{cite web|title=The European Parliament: electoral procedures |publisher=European Parliament |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/facts/1_3_4_en.htm |accessdate=12 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617144910/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/facts/1_3_4_en.htm |archivedate=17 June 2007 |df= }}</ref>

The most recent Union-wide elections to the European Parliament were the [[European Parliament election, 2014|European elections of 2014]], held from 22 to 25 May 2014. They were the largest simultaneous transnational elections ever held anywhere in the world.
The eighth term of Parliament started on 1 July 2014.<ref>
{{cite press release |title=At the end of EP seventh legislature: presidential debate, election night, constitution of groups, constitution of the new Parliament |publisher= European Parliament|date= 17 April 2014|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140417IPR44805/html/Series-of-events-from-end-of-seventh-EP-term-to-constitution-of-new-EP|accessdate=4 June 2014|quote=The new, eighth, Parliament will be constituted on 1 July . . ."}}</ref>

The proportion of MEPs elected in 2009 who were female was 35%; in 1979 it was just 16.5%.

There have been a number of proposals designed to attract greater public attention to the elections. One such innovation in the 2014 elections was that the [[European political party|pan-European political parties]] fielded "candidates" for [[President of the European Commission|president]] of the [[European Commission|Commission]], the so-called ''Spitzenkandidaten'' (German, "leading candidates" or "top candidates"). However, European Union governance is based on a mixture of intergovernmental and supranational features: the President of the European Commission is nominated by the European Council, representing the governments of the member states, and there is no obligation for them to nominate the successful "candidate". The Lisbon Treaty merely states that they should take account of the results of the elections when choosing whom to nominate. The so-called ''Spitzenkandidaten'' were  [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] for the [[European People's Party]], [[Martin Schulz]] for the [[Party of European Socialists]], [[Guy Verhofstadt]] for the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]], [[Ska Keller]] and [[José Bové]] jointly for the [[European Green Party]] and [[Alexis Tsipras]] for the [[Party of the European Left]].

Turnout has dropped consistently every year since the first election, and from 1999 it has been below 50%. In 2007 both [[European Parliament election, 2007|Bulgaria and Romania elected their MEPs]] in by-elections, having joined at the beginning of 2007. The Bulgarian and Romanian elections saw two of the lowest turnouts for European elections, just 28.6%<ref>{{cite web|title=New GERB party narrowly wins Bulgaria's first European Parliament election|date=21 May 2007|publisher=[[Southeast European Times]]|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/05/21/nb-01|accessdate=8 July 2007}}</ref> and 28.3% respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Romania chooses its 35 MEPS|date=26 November 2007|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/011-13241-329-11-47-902-20071115STO13229-2007-25-11-2007/default_en.htm|accessdate=24 February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213202736/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/011-13241-329-11-47-902-20071115STO13229-2007-25-11-2007/default_en.htm|archivedate=13 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In England, Scotland and Wales, EP elections were originally held for a constituency MEP on a first-past-the-post basis.  In 1999 the system was changed to a form of [[proportional representation|PR]] where a large group of candidates would stand for a post within a very large regional constituency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/voting-in-the-uk/european-elections|title=Ways of voting - GOV.UK|publisher=}}</ref>  One could vote for a party, but not a candidate (unless that party had a single candidate).

Each year the activities of the Parliament cycle between committee weeks where reports are discussed in committees and interparliamentary delegations meet, political group weeks for members to discuss work within their political groups and session weeks where members spend 3½ days in [[Strasbourg]] for part-sessions. In addition six 2-day part-sessions are organised in [[Brussels]] throughout the year. Four weeks are allocated as constituency week to allow members to do exclusively constituency work. Finally there are no meetings planned during the summer weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title = European Parliament 2007 calendar of activities|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sed/doc/ext/hemicycle/PLAN_BRU.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =14 September 2009 }}</ref> The Parliament has the power to meet without being convened by another authority.

Members are arranged in a [[Hemicycle (chamber)|hemicycle]] according to their political groups (in the Common Assembly, prior to 1958, members sat alphabetically<ref name="Corbett 167"/>) who are ordered mainly by left to right, but some smaller groups are placed towards the outer ring of the Parliament. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for translation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are taken up by the Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences.<ref>{{cite web|title = Brussels seating plan|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sce/data/fast_access/doc//PLAN_BRX_30%20JAN_2008.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227035017/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sce/data/fast_access/doc//PLAN_BRX_30%20JAN_2008.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 February 2008|format=PDF|accessdate =12 June 2007 }}</ref> The hemicycle design is a compromise between the different Parliamentary systems.

The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the [[French Revolution]]. The 180 ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black [[Tailcoat|tails]] and wearing a silver chain, and are [[EU Concours|recruited]] in the same manner as the [[European Civil Service|European civil service]].

===President and organisation===
{{Main|President of the European Parliament}}
[[File:Antonio Tajani March 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|President [[Antonio Tajani]].]]
The President is essentially the [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]] of the Parliament and presides over the plenary when it is in session. The President's signature is required for all acts adopted by co-decision, including the EU budget. The President is also responsible for representing the Parliament externally, including in legal matters, and for the application of the rules of procedure. He or she is elected for two-and-a-half-year terms, meaning two elections per parliamentary term.<ref>{{cite web|title = Duties of the President|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20040720+RULE-019+DOC+XML+V0//EN&navigationBar=YES|accessdate =12 June 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Functions|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/the-president/en/president/functions.html|accessdate =20 September 2012}}</ref> The President is currently [[Antonio Tajani]] MEP of the EPP.

In most countries, the protocol of the [[head of state]] comes before all others; however, in the EU the Parliament is listed as the first institution, and hence the protocol of its president comes before any other European, or national, protocol. The gifts given to numerous visiting dignitaries depend upon the President. President [[Josep Borrell]] MEP of Spain gave his counterparts a crystal cup created by an artist from Barcelona who had engraved upon it parts of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] among other things.<ref name="Protocol">{{cite web|title = Parliament's Protocol Service |date=28 July 2006|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20060728FCS09980&secondRef=0|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate =28 October 2007 }}</ref>

A number of notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors.

Below the President, there are 14 [[Vice President of the European Parliament|Vice-Presidents]] who chair debates when the President is not in the chamber. There are a number of other bodies and posts responsible for the running of parliament besides these speakers. The two main bodies are the [[Bureau (European Parliament)|Bureau]], which is responsible for budgetary and administration issues, and the [[Conference of Presidents]] which is a governing body composed of the presidents of each of the parliament's political groups. Looking after the financial and administrative interests of members are five [[Quaestor (European Parliament)|Quaestors]].

Each month, the EP moves back and forth to meet the EU obligation to hold meetings also in France.]]
The Parliament has 20 [[Standing Committee]]s consisting of 25 to 73 MEPs each (reflecting the political make-up of the whole Parliament) including a chair, a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to be presented to the plenary.<ref name="Organised">{{cite web|title = Organisation|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/20150201PVL00010/Organisation|accessdate =3 May 2016|quote=In order to do the preparatory work for Parliament's plenary sittings, the Members are divided up among a number of specialised standing committees.

In the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the [[Committee on Budgetary Control|Budgetary Control Committee's]] narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.<ref name="Ringe">{{cite web  | last =Ringer  | first =Nils F.  | title =The Santer Commission Resignation Crisis  | publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]  |date=February 2003  | url =http://aei.pitt.edu/2919/01/156.pdf  | format =PDF  | accessdate =7 October 2007 }}</ref>

Committees can also set up sub-committees (e.g. the [[Subcommittee on Human Rights]]) and temporary committees to deal with a specific topic (e.g. on [[extraordinary rendition]]). The chairs of the Committees co-ordinate their work through the "[[Committees of the European Parliament#Conference of Committee Chairs|Conference of Committee Chairmen]]".<ref name="Organised"/> When co-decision was introduced it increased the Parliament's powers in a number of areas, but most notably those covered by the [[Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety]]. Previously this committee was considered by MEPs as a "[[Cinderella]] committee"; however, as it gained a new importance, it became more professional and rigorous, attracting increasing attention to its work.<ref name="Hoskyns"/>

[[File:Committee Room of the European Parliament in Brussels.jpg|thumb|left|A Committee room in the Parliament]]
The nature of the committees differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison to those of the [[United States Congressional committee|United States Congress]], the European Parliament's committees are unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff. Considerable administration, archives and research resources are also at the disposal of the whole Parliament when needed.<ref name="Kreppel"/>

[[European Parliament Delegations|Delegations of the Parliament]] are formed in a similar manner and are responsible for relations with Parliaments outside the EU. There are 34 delegations made up of around 15 MEPs, chairpersons of the delegations also cooperate in a conference like the committee chairs do. They include "Interparliamentary delegations" (maintain relations with Parliament outside the EU), "joint parliamentary committees" (maintaining relations with parliaments of states which are candidates or associates of the EU), the  delegation to the [[ACP EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly]] and the delegation to the [[Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly]].<ref name="Organised"/> MEPs also participate in other international activities such as the [[Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly]], the [[Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue]] and through [[Election monitoring|election observation]] in third countries.<ref>{{cite web|title =European Parliament: In Detail|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert.do?language=EN|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate =9 July 2007 }}</ref>

===Intergroups===
The [[Intergroups in the European Parliament]] are informal fora which gather MEPs from various political groups around any topic. They do not express the view of the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s.<ref>[http://www.cairn.info/revue-politique-europeenne-2003-1-page-123.htm Dutoit Laurent, « L'influence au sein du Parlement européen : les intergroupes », Politique européenne 1/2003 (n° 9), p. 123-142].</ref> They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example) must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests.<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/intergroupes/legislature_8/DecisionofCoPof16Dec1999-Rules_governing_the_establishment_of_integroupes.pdf Article 6, Rules governing the establishment of intergroups, decision of the Conference of Presidents, 16 december 1999 (last updated 11 September 2014)]</ref> Also Intergroups are established or renewed at the beginning of each legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 political groups whose support is limited to a specific number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014-2019, the EPP or S&D political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/intergroupes/legislature_8/DecisionofCoPof16Dec1999-Rules_governing_the_establishment_of_integroupes.pdf Annex 1, Rules governing the establishment of intergroups, decision of the Conference of Presidents, 16 december 1999 (last updated 11 September 2014)]</ref>

===Translation and interpretation===
Speakers in the European Parliament are entitled to speak in any of the 24 official [[languages of the European Union]], ranging from French and German to [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and Irish. Simultaneous interpreting is offered in all plenary sessions, and all final texts of legislation are translated. With twenty-four languages, the European Parliament is the most multilingual parliament in the world<ref>{{cite web|title = Press Release: Irish language arrives in European Parliament|date=11 January 2007|publisher=European Parliament Irish Office|url=http://www.europarl.ie/news_press_release_2_2007.html|accessdate =12 June 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103833/http://www.europarl.ie/news_press_release_2_2007.html| archivedate = 28 September 2007}}</ref> and the biggest employer of interpreters in the world (employing 350 full-time and 400 free-lancers when there is higher demand).<ref name="Interpreters">{{cite web|title = The European Parliament's Interpreters.|date=12 April 2006|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20060403FCS06935&secondRef=0|accessdate =21 June 2007}}</ref> Citizens may also address the Parliament in [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Valencian]] and [[Galician language|Galician]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The European Parliament allows the written communication of citizens in Basques in Basque, Catalan and Galician. |year=2006 |publisher=Ciemen |url=http://www.ciemen.org/mercator/notidetail.cfm?IDA=897&lg=gb |accessdate=21 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003800/http://www.ciemen.org/mercator/notidetail.cfm?IDA=897&lg=gb |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}</ref>

Usually a language is translated from a foreign tongue into a translator's native tongue. Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 interpreting is sometimes done the opposite way, out of an interpreter's native tongue (the "retour" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be interpreted through a third language for lack of interpreters ("relay" interpreting)&nbsp;—for example, when interpreting out of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] into [[Maltese language|Maltese]].<ref name="Interpreters"/> Due to the complexity of the issues, interpretation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This requires detailed understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question). Difficulty can often arise when MEPs use profanities, jokes and word play or speak too fast.<ref name="Interpreters"/>

While some see speaking their native language as an important part of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some. A 2006 report by [[Alexander Stubb]] MEP highlighted that by only using English, French and German costs could be reduced from [[Euro|€]]118,000 per day (for 21 languages then—[[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] having not yet been included) to €8,900 per day.<ref>{{cite web|title = In European Parliament, debate—in 21 languages—can be pricey|date=12 September 2006|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0912/p05s01-woeu.html|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate =12 June 2007 }}</ref> Some see the ideal single language as being English due to its widespread usage, although there has been a small-scale campaign to make French the reference language for all legal texts, due to the fact that it is more clear and precise for legal purposes.<ref>{{cite web|title = Campaign to make French sole legal language in EU|date=7 February 2007|work=International Herald Tribune |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/07/europe/EU-GEN-EU-French.php|accessdate =12 June 2007 }}</ref>

Because the proceedings are translated into all of the official EU languages, they have been used to make a multilingual [[Text corpus|corpus]] known as [[Europarl corpus|Europarl]].  It is widely used to train [[statistical machine translation]] systems.<ref>Philipp Koehn (2005) Europarl: [http://www.iccs.inf.ed.ac.uk/~pkoehn/publications/europarl-mtsummit05.pdf A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation], in ''MT Summit 2005''</ref>

== Annual costs ==
According to the European Parliament website, the annual parliament budget for 2016 was €1.838 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/en/about-us/faqs.html|title=Enquiries & FAQs (#11)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|access-date=}}</ref> The main cost categories were:

* 34% - staff, interpretation and translation costs
* 24% - information policy, IT, telecommunications
* 23% - MEPs' salaries, expenses, travel, offices and staff
* 13% - buildings
* 6% - political group activities

According to a European Parliament study prepared in 2013, the Strasbourg seat costs an extra €103 million over maintaining a single location and according to the Court of Auditors an additional €5 million is related to travel expenses caused by having two seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/faq/19/why-does-parliament-move-between-brussels-and-strasbourg|title=Why does Parliament move between Brussels and Strasbourg?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|access-date=}}</ref>

As a comparison, the German lower house of parliament ([[Bundestag]]) is estimated to cost €517 million in total for 2018, for a parliament with 709 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article169033905/So-viel-zahlen-die-Deutschen-fuer-die-Demokratie.html|title=So viel zahlen die Deutschen für die Demokratie|last=|first=|date=|website=www.welt.de|access-date=}}</ref> The British [[House of Commons]] reported total annual costs in 2016-2017 of £249 million (€279 million). It had 650 seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-expenditure/Admin%20Annual%20Accounts/AdminAnnualReport1617.pdf|title=Annual Report and Accounts 2016–17, p. 70|last=House of Commons|first=|date=|website=www.parliament.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718205626/https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-expenditure/Admin%20Annual%20Accounts/AdminAnnualReport1617.pdf|archive-date=18 July 2018|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

According to ''The Economist'', the European Parliament costs more than the British, French and German parliaments combined. A quarter of the costs is estimated to be related to translation and interpretation costs (c. €460 million) and the double seats are estimated to add an additional €180 million a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/comment/2382895|title=Elected, yet strangely unaccountable|last=Economist|first=|date=May 15, 2014|website=www.economist.com|access-date=}}</ref> For a like-for-like comparison, these two cost blocks can be excluded. The resulting costs of c. €1.2 billion a year are still more than double the German Bundestag's costs or more than four times the costs of the British House of Commons.

On 2 July 2018, MEPs rejected proposals to tighten the rules around the General Expenditure Allowance (GEA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/strasbourg-european-parliament-meps-reject-scrutiny-of-expenses/|title=MEPs reject scrutiny of their expenses|last=|first=|date=July 3, 2018|website=www.politico.eu|access-date=}}</ref>, which "is a controversial €4,416 per month payment that MEPs are given to cover office and other expenses, but they are not required to provide any evidence of how the money is spent"<ref>[https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-european-parliament-nigel-farage-daniel-hannan-british-members-of-european-parliament-to-bag-lucrative-post-brexit-pay-out/ MAÏA DE LA BAUME, ''British MEPs to bag lucrative post-Brexit payout'', Politico, 9 Jan. 2019].</ref>.

The Parliament is based in three different cities with numerous buildings. A protocol attached to the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] requires that 12 plenary sessions be held in [[Strasbourg]] (none in August but two in September), which is the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions as well as committee meetings are held in [[Brussels]].

The Strasbourg seat is seen as a symbol of reconciliation between France and Germany, the Strasbourg region having been fought over by the two countries in the past. However, the cost and inconvenience of having two seats is questioned. While Strasbourg is the official seat, and sits alongside the [[Council of Europe]],<ref>{{cite web|title = The Council of Europe and the European Union sign an agreement to foster mutual cooperation|date=23 May 2007|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR331(2007)&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE&ShowBanner=no&Target=_self|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|accessdate =12 June 2007 }}</ref> [[Brussels and the European Union|Brussels is home to nearly all other major EU institutions]], with the majority of Parliament's work being carried out there.

Over the last few years, European institutions have committed to promoting transparency, openness, and the availability of information about their work.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Juan Mayoral|date=February 2011|title=Democratic improvements in the European Union under the Lisbon Treaty Institutional changes regarding democratic government in the EU|publisher=European Union Democracy Observatory (EUDO).

===Dialogue with religious and non-confessional organisations===

Article 17 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (TFEU) lays the juridical foundation for an open, transparent dialogue between European institutions and churches, religious associations, and non-confessional and philosophical organisations.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/it/20160919PVL00112/Dialogo-con-le-religioni-e-le-organizzazioni-non-confessionali|title=Dialogo con le organizzazioni religiose e non confessionali Articolo 17 TFUE|website=europarl.europa.eu|publisher=Parlamento europeo|access-date=22 May 2017|language=it}}</ref> In July 2014, in the beginning of the 8th term, then President of the European Parliament [[Martin Schulz]] tasked [[Antonio Tajani]], then Vice-President, with implementing the dialogue with the religious and confessional organisations included in article 17.<ref>{{Cite news|autore=|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2015/03/27/vaticaninsider/ita/nel-mondo/lue-a-bruxelles-il-dialogo-interreligioso-come-strategia-contro-lestremismo-bbjEnG3KL5FtW7ykRfeElO/pagina.html|title=L’Ue a Bruxelles: il dialogo interreligioso come strategia contro l’estremismo|publisher=La Stampa|date=27 March 2015|access-date=22 May 2017|language=it}}</ref> In this framework, the European Parliament hosts high-level conferences on inter-religious dialogue, also with focus on current issues and in relation with parliamentary works.<ref name=":0" />

===European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction===

The chair of European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction was established in 1987 by initiative of British politician and MEP Charles [[Henry Plumb]], with the goal of helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried.<ref>{{Cite news|autore=|url=http://www.altalex.com/documents/news/2015/04/10/sottrazione-internazionale-e-mediazione|title=Sottrazione internazionale di minore: ammessa la mediazione familiare|publisher=Altalex|date=19 June 2015|access-date=22 May 2017|language=it}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/it/20150201PVL00040/Mediatore-europeo-per-i-casi-di-sottrazione-di-minori|title=Mediatore del Parlamento europeo per i casi di sottrazione internazionale di minori|website=europarl.europa.eu|publisher=Parlamento europeo|access-date=22 May 2017}}</ref> Since its institution, the chair has been held by [[Mairead McGuinness]] (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994).<ref name=":1" /> The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties.<ref name=":1" /> In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.<ref name=":1" />

==European Parliamentary Research Service==
The [[European Parliamentary Research Service]] (EPRS) is the European Parliament's in-house research department and think tank. It provides [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] – and, where appropriate, [[Committees of the European Parliament|parliamentary committees]] – with independent, objective and authoritative analysis of, and research on, policy issues relating to the European Union, in order to assist them in their parliamentary work. It is also designed to increase Members' and EP committees' capacity to scrutinise and oversee the [[European Commission]] and other [[Bodies of the European Union|EU executive bodies]].

EPRS aims to provide a comprehensive range of products and services, backed by specialist internal expertise and knowledge sources in all policy fields, so empowering Members and committees through knowledge and contributing to the Parliament's effectiveness and influence as an institution. In undertaking this work, the EPRS supports and promotes parliamentary outreach to the wider public, including dialogue with relevant stakeholders in the [[European Union|EU]]’s system of multi-level governance. All publications by EPRS are publicly available on the EP Think Tank platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/20150201PVL00031/European-Parliamentary-Research-Service |title=European Parliamentary Research Service |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2017-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/EPRS/The_work_of_EPRS-2014_to_2016.pdf|title=The work of EPRS – The first three years: 2014 to 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=European Parliamentary Research Service|format=PDF|accessdate=2017-09-07}}</ref>
 
==Eurobarometer of the European Parliament==

The European Parliament periodically commissions opinion polls and studies on public opinion trends in Member States to survey perceptions and expectations of citizens about its work and the overall activities of the European Union. Topics include citizens' perception of the European Parliament's role, their knowledge of the institution, their sense of belonging in the European Union, opinions on European elections and European integration, identity, citizenship, political values, but also on current issues such as climate change, current economy and politics, etc.. [[Eurobarometer]] analyses seek to provide an overall picture of national situations, regional specificities, socio-demographic cleavages, and historical trends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/20161110PVL00113/Eurobarometer|title=Parlemeter 2016|website=europarl.europa.eu|access-date=23 May 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.it/it/scoprire-l-europa/eurobarometro-i-sondaggi-d-opinione-del-pe?webaction=view.acceptCookies|title=Eurobarometro: i sondaggi d'opinione del PE|website=europarl.it|access-date=23 May 2017|language=it}}</ref>
