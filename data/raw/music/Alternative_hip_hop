'''Alternative hip hop''' (also known as '''alternative rap''') is a subgenre of [[hip hop music]] that encompasses the wide range of styles that are not typically identified as mainstream. [[AllMusic]] defines it as follows: "Alternative rap refers to [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] groups that refuse to conform to any of the traditional stereotypes of rap, such as [[Gangsta rap|gangsta]], [[Miami bass|bass]], [[hardcore hip hop|hardcore]], [[Pop-rap|pop]], and [[party rap]]. Instead, they blur genres drawing equally from [[funk]] and [[Pop rock|pop/rock]], as well as [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[reggae]], and even [[Folk music|folk]]."<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/alternative-rap-ma0000012203|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|title=Alternative Rap Music Genre|accessdate=20 May 2017}}</ref>

Alternative hip hop developed in the late 1980s and experienced a degree of [[Mainstream radio|mainstream]] recognition during the early-to-mid 1990s. While some groups such as [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]] and [[The Fugees]] managed to achieve commercial success before breaking up, most alternative rap acts tended to be embraced largely by [[alternative rock]] listeners rather than hip-hop or [[Pop music|pop]] audiences.<ref name="Allmusic"/> The commercial and cultural momentum was impeded by the then also emerging, significantly harder-edged West Coast [[gangsta rap]]. A resurgence came about in the late 1990s and early 2000s at the dawn of the [[digital era]] with rejuvenated interest in [[independent music]] by the general public.

During the 2000s, alternative hip hop reattained its place within the mainstream, due to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap as well as the [[Crossover music|crossover]] success of artists such as [[OutKast]] and [[Kanye West]]. The alternative hip hop movement has expanded beyond the United States to include the [[Somali people|Somali]]-Canadian poet [[K'naan]], Japanese rapper [[Shing02]], and English artist [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] Alternative hip hop acts have attained much critical acclaim, but receive relatively little exposure through radio and other media outlets.

==History==

===Origin===
Originating in the late 1980s, in midst of the [[Golden age hip hop|golden age of hip hop]], alternative hip hop was headed primarily by [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast]] groups such as [[De La Soul]], [[Jungle Brothers]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], and [[Digable Planets]] in subsidiary conjunction by [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] acts such as [[The Pharcyde]], [[Digital Underground]], and [[Freestyle Fellowship]] as well as certain [[Southern hip hop|Southern]] acts such as [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]], [[Goodie Mob]], and [[OutKast]]. Similar to the [[alternative rock]] movement, alternative hip hop segued into the mainstream at the dawn of the 1990s. Arrested Development along with [[The Fugees]], stand as some of the first few alternative rap to be recognized by mainstream audiences.<ref name="Allmusic"/> The classic debut albums ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]]'', ''[[People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm]]'', and ''[[Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde]]'' achieved minor commercial success as they garnered immense acclaim from music critics, who described the records as managing to be both ambitiously innovative but playful masterpieces, hailing the artists as the future of hip hop music as a whole.<ref name=Erlewine/> Christened as "The ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]'' of hip hop", De La Soul's debut album ''3 Feet High and Rising'' was considered the forefront of the subgenre. As music critic Jon Bush wrote in retrospect:

{{quote|The most inventive, assured, and playful debut in hip-hop history, ''3 Feet High and Rising'' not only proved that rappers didn't have to talk about the streets to succeed, but also expanded the palette of sampling material with a kaleidoscope of sounds and references culled from [[pop music|pop]], [[soul music|soul]], [[disco]], and even [[country music]]. Weaving clever wordplay and deft rhymes across two dozen tracks loosely organized around a game-show theme, De La Soul broke down boundaries all over the LP, moving easily from the groovy my-philosophy intro "The Magic Number" to an intelligent, caring inner-city vignette named "Ghetto Thang" to the freewheeling end-of-innocence tale "Jenifa Taught Me (Derwin's Revenge)." Rappers Posdnuos and Trugoy the Dove talked about anything they wanted (up to and including [[body odor]]), playing fast and loose on the mic like Biz Markie. Thinly disguised under a layer of humor, their lyrical themes ranged from true love ("[[Eye Know]]") to the destructive power of [[drugs]] ("Say No Go") to Daisy Age philosophy ("Tread Water") to [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] ("Buddy"). [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]] (from [[Stetsasonic]]) and DJ Pasemaster Mase led the way on the production end, with dozens of [[music sampling|samples]] from all sorts of left-field artists—including [[Johnny Cash]], [[The Mad Lads]], [[Steely Dan]], [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], [[Hall & Oates]], and [[the Turtles]]. The pair didn't just use those samples as [[hook (music)|hooks]] or drumbreaks—like most hip-hop producers had in the past—but as split-second fills and in-jokes that made some tracks sound more like DJ records. Even "Potholes on My Lawn," which samples a mouth harp and yodeling (for the chorus, no less), became a big R&B hit. If it was easy to believe the revolution was here from listening to the rapping and production on [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]'', with De La Soul the Daisy Age seemed to promise a new era of positivity in hip-hop.|Jon Bush}}

=== Mid–late 1990s: Mainstream decline ===
Contrary to [[alternative rock]], which went on to become a mainstay in mainstream music and replaced the [[glam metal]] of the previous generation as the most popular form of rock music, alternative hip hop's commercial momentum was impeded by the then also newly emerging, significantly harder-edged West Coast [[gangsta rap]].<ref name=Erlewine>{{cite web |author=Erlewine, Stephen|title=De La Soul|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p69369/biography|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=March 25, 2007}}</ref> With its aggressive tone, nihilistic tendencies, and violent imagery, gangsta rap was considered to be the more entertaining, more lucrative subgenre as signified by the high chart placings, radio success and [[multi-platinum|multiplatinum]]-selling records of gangsta rappers such as [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Warren G]] and [[N.W.A]], who were widely embraced by [[major record label]]s and produced a legion of imitators.<ref name=Erlewine/> Albums such as ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', ''[[The Chronic]]'' and ''[[Doggystyle]]'' redefined the direction of hip hop, which resulted in lyricism concerning the gangsta lifestyle becoming the driving force of sales figures.<ref name="Caramanica">Caramanica, Jon. [https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/128098/review/6211658/straightouttacompton Review: ''Straight Outta Compton'']. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. Retrieved July 22, 2009.</ref> The situation broke way around the mid-90s with the emergence and mainstream popularity of East Coast [[hardcore rap]] artists such as [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Nas]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], and [[Mobb Deep]]. Both West Coast gangsta rap and East Coast hardcore and their many derivatives subsequently became more prominent in [[popular music]], whereas alt-rap became largely relegated to the [[underground hip hop|underground scene]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Following this development, many alternative rap acts eventually either disbanded or faded into obscurity.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In his 1995 book on the current state of [[hip hop culture]], music critic Stephen Rodrick wrote that, at that time, alternative hip-hop had "drawn little more than barely concealed yawns from other rappers and [[urban music|urban]] audiences" and came to the conclusion that the subgenre was a complete failure.<ref name=Rodrick>Rodrick; pp. 115–116</ref>

=== 2000s–2010s: Revival ===
However, a resurgence came about in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the rejuvenated interest in [[indie music]] by the general public. Since the mid-90's, [[independent record label]]s such as [[Rawkus Records]], [[Rhymesayers]], [[Anticon]], [[Stones Throw Records|Stones Throw]] and [[Definitive Jux]] have experienced lesser mainstream success with alternative rap acts such as [[Daniel Dumile|MF DOOM]], [[Atmosphere (hip hop group)|Atmosphere]], [[Antipop Consortium]], [[Black Star (hip hop group)|Black Star]], [[Doomtree]], [[Pharoahe Monch]], [[El-P]], [[Aesop Rock]], [[Mos Def]], and [[Talib Kweli]]. It was in the 2000s that alternative hip hop reattained its place within the mainstream, due in part to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap as well as the crossover success of artists such as [[OutKast]], [[Kanye West]], and [[Gnarls Barkley]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Michel, Sia|title=Critics' Choice: New CD's | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/18/arts/critics-choice-new-cds-860069.html| work=[[The New York Times]]  | date=September 18, 2006 | accessdate=May 10, 2008}}</ref>

Not only did OutKast's fifth studio album ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'' receive universal acclaim from music critics and manage to appeal listeners of all ages spanning numerous musical genres but also spawned two number-one hit singles. The album eventually went on to win a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]—making it only the second hip hop album to win the award—and has been [[RIAA certification|certified]] [[Music recording sales certification|diamond]] by selling 11 times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipping more than 11 million units, becoming one of the best selling albums of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/diamond.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818085906/http://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/diamond.asp |archivedate=August 18, 2006 }}</ref>

Gnarls Barkley experienced a surprise hit with their debut single "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]". Due to high download sales, it reached number-one of the single charts in several countries, including the United Kingdom, where it became the best selling single of 2006.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/top40_2006.shtml Top 40 Singles of 2006], from BBC Radio 1 website</ref> The song was named the best song of 2006 by both ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and the ''[[Village Voice]]'''s annual [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/12769472/the_100_best_songs_of_2006/1| title=Rolling Stone : The 100 Best Songs of 2006 |work=Rolling Stone| date=December 8, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724193535/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/12769472/the_100_best_songs_of_2006/1|archivedate=July 24, 2008}}</ref><ref name="pazz">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219084959/http://www.villagevoice.com/pazzandjop06/winners.php?type=single|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/pazzandjop06/winners.php?type=single|title=Pazz & Jop 2006: Singles Winners|work=[[The Village Voice]]|archivedate=February 19, 2007|accessdate=November 29, 2008}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' later ranked "Crazy" as the number-one song of the entire decade.

Industry observers view the 2007 [[Graduation (album)#Release and promotion|sales competition]] between Kanye West's ''[[Graduation (album)|Graduation]]'' and 50 Cent's ''[[Curtis (50 Cent album)|Curtis]]'' as a turning point for hip hop. West emerged the victor, selling nearly a million copies in the first week alone. Ben Detrick of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' cited the outcome of the sales competition as being responsible for altering the direction of hip hop and paving the way for new rappers who didn't follow the [[hardcore hip hop|hardcore]]-[[gangsta rap|gangster]] mold, writing, "If there was ever a [[wiktionary:watershed|watershed]] moment to indicate hip hop's changing direction, it may have come when 50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007 to see whose album would claim superior sales. 50 lost handily, and it was made clear that excellent songcrafting trumped a street-life experience. Kanye led a wave of new artists—[[Kid Cudi]], [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]], [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[Kidz in the Hall]], [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]—who lacked the interest or ability to create narratives about any past gunplay or [[drug-dealing]]."<ref name="XXL">{{cite journal | author=Detrick, Ben|authorlink=XXL (magazine) |title=Reality Check |journal= [[XXL Magazine|XXL]]|date=December 2010 |pages=114}}</ref> Similarly, in a retrospective article, Rosie Swash of ''[[The Guardian]]'' viewed the album's sales competition with 50 Cent's ''Curtis'' as a historical moment in hip hop, writing that it "highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative."<ref>Swash, Rosie (June 13, 2011).

Several burgeoning artists and groups acknowledge being directly influenced by their 1990s predecessors in addition to alternative rock groups while their music has been noted by critics as expressing eclectic sounds, life experiences and emotions rarely seen in mainstream hip hop.<ref name=Soul>{{cite journal |last=Hoard |first=Christian |date=September 17, 2009|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423002154/http://datnewcudi.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/cudi_rollingstone.jpeg||title=Kid Cudi: Hip-Hop's Sensitive Soul|journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue= 1087|pages=40 }}</ref> As traditional rock music becomes decreasingly becomes less synonymous with [[popular music]], genre-bending, left-of-center rap artists who are not fully embraced by hip-hop radio continue to find more acceptance and inclusion on [[alternative radio]].<ref name="Unterberger">{{cite magazine |last=Unterberger|first=Andrew|date=January 12, 2018 |title=Why Alt-Radio Is Suddenly Embracing Hip-Hop|url=https://shop.billboard.com/products/january-12-2019-issue-1|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |location= |publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc]]| volume=|issue=1| page=| issn=|access-date=January 17, 2018}}</ref> According to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], contemporary hip-hop acts who increasingly receive domestic airplay on alt-radio include [[Run the Jewels]], [[Childish Gambino]], [[Logic (rapper)|Logic]], [[Brockhampton (band)|Brockhampton]], [[Lift (band)|L.I.F.T.]] and [[Nothing,Nowhere|nothing, nowhere]].<ref name="Unterberger"/> Regarding audiences, according to Jeff Regan, senior director of music programming for the [[Alt Nation]] channel on [[Sirius XM Satellite Radio|Sirius XM Radio]], "This generation has maybe never even gone to a [[record store]] or CD store where there was a hip-hop section and a rock section — it has all been in front of them on a screen."<ref name="Unterberger"/> Its for this reason that recording artists and groups traditionally perceived as rappers are included on his predominately [[Rock music|rock]]-oriented playlists, saying, "Whether it’s [[Lil Peep]] or Brockhampton or [[Post Malone]], we have tried records from all those artists. ...

==Critical and cultural reactions==
While some groups managed to achieve commercial success, most alternative rap acts tended to be embraced largely by [[alternative rock]] listeners and [[indie music]] fans rather than hip-hop or [[Pop music|pop]] audiences.<ref name="Allmusic"/> Artists receive limited exposure through [[commercial radio]] and other media outlets and primarily rely on [[campus radio]] and various [[independent media]] channels.<ref name="Allmusic"/> Alternative hip hop is the recipient of consistent critical acclaim but is generally shunned by American [[mainstream media]] and widely regarded as a commercially unappealing.<ref name=Erlewine/> New York radio personality and [[spoken word]] artist [[Imhotep Gary Byrd]]'s single "The Crown" was rejected by American radio stations for being "too Black and too positive."<ref name="Afro.com"/> However, the song was very well received and become a hit in Europe.<ref name="Afro.com">{{cite web|author=NNPA Newswire Correspondent|title=Coalition Wants End to Broadcasting Music That Encourages Violence Against Blacks|url=https://www.afro.com/coalition-wants-end-to-broadcasting-music-that-encourages-violence-against-blacks/ |publisher=Afro.com |date=December 5, 2018 |accessdate=December 29, 2018}}</ref> It reached number 6 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becaming the longest record ever to reach the top 10 in the history of the British Charts.<ref>{{cite web|author= |title=Emmis Cancels Gary Byrds GBE On WLIB-AM|url=http://www.blackstarnews.com/us-politics/news/emmis-cancels-gary-byrds-gbe-on-wlib-am.html|publisher=Black Star News |date=2015-04-16}}</ref> Over the years, multiple organizations representing African-Americans such as the National Black Leadership Alliance and the [[National Congress of Black Women]] have released statements criticizing how [[Urban contemporary|urban]] radio stations refuse to play rap music that does not demean and degrade black women, censoring out alternative hip-hop artists such as [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]] and [[Dead Prez]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://images.inksoft.com/images/publishers/6706/stores/Knot_Forgotten_LLC/7a9d67ab-95ab-41da-93ce-a0a8b6dd0c6d.pdf|publisher=|title=National Black Leadership Alliance & National Congress of Black Women Joint Statement|date=October 15, 2018|accessdate=December 29, 2018}}</ref> [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]], frontman of the highly influential alternative rap group A Tribe Called Quest, had his sophomore solo effort ''[[Kamaal/The Abstract]]'' shelved for nearly a decade after his record label deemed the genre-bending album as sounding uncommercial.<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/57667 Inventory: 11 Intriguing Lost Albums article on The A.V.

K'naan's 2009 single [[Wavin' Flag]] reached number two on the [[Canadian Hot 100]] while its various remixes topped the charts in several countries.
