The '''Official Charts Company''', also referred to as '''Official Charts''' (previously known as the '''Chart Information Network''' ('''CIN''') and '''The Official UK Charts Company''') is a British inter-professional organisation that compiles various "official" [[record chart]]s in the United Kingdom, including the [[UK Singles Chart]], the [[UK Albums Chart]], the [[UK Singles Downloads Chart]] and the [[UK Album Downloads Chart]], as well as [[music genre|genre]]-specific and music video charts. The OCC produces its charts by gathering and combining sales data from retailers through market researchers [[Millward Brown]], and claims to cover 99% of the singles market and 95% of the album market, and aims to collect data from any retailer who sells more than 100 chart items per week.<ref name=OCCIPack>{{cite web |title=OCC Information Pack |accessdate=8 May 2008 |publisher=Official Charts |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/docs/Information_Pack_June_2004.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413212134/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/docs/Information_Pack_June_2004.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 April 2008}}</ref>

The OCC is operated jointly by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] and the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA) (formerly the British Association of Record Dealers (BARD)). Since 1 July 1997, CIN and then the OCC have compiled the official charts. Prior to this date, the charts were produced by a succession of market research companies, beginning with the British Market Research Bureau in 1969, and later by [[Gallup poll|Gallup]]. Before the production of the 'official" charts, various less comprehensive charts were produced, most notably by newspaper/magazine ''[[New Musical Express]]'' (''NME'') which began its chart in 1952; some of these older charts (including ''NME''{{'}}s earliest singles charts) are now part of the official OCC canon.

==Chart synopsis ==
All of the OCC's charts are published weekly on Friday nights, and cover sales for the preceding week, Friday to Thursday. From 3 August 1969 until 5 July 2015, the chart week ran from Sunday to Saturday. Genre-specific charts include [[UK Dance Chart]], [[UK Indie Chart]], [[UK R&B Chart]], [[UK Rock Chart]] and the Asian Download Chart. The [[Scottish Singles and Albums Charts]] ― and the former Welsh Singles and Albums Chart ― appears in listings within the Official Charts Company. It is a regional listing reflecting how sales towards the [[UK Singles Chart]] and [[UK Albums Chart]] are faring in [[Scotland]]. The Welsh Singles and Album Chart served the same purpose in [[Wales]]. It also charts the [[UK DVD Chart]] and UK Budget Album Chart. While their music charts are now Friday to Thursday, their video charts remain Sunday to Saturday.

On 5 September 2008, the Official UK Charts Company rebranded itself as the Official Charts Company and introduced a new company logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=1035409&c=1|title=OCC re-brand is Official|last=Carde|first=Ben|date=5 September 2008|work=[[Music Week]]|accessdate=6 September 2008}}</ref> It later dropped the word 'Company' and became just "Official Charts".

From May 2012, a new chart was launched – the [[Official Streaming Chart]]. This counts audio streams from streaming services [[Spotify]], [[Deezer]], [[Blinkbox Music]], [[Napster]], amongst others. The chart is the first of its kind to rank streams from ad-funded and subscription services and the Official Streaming Chart Top 100 is now published weekly<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uks-first-official-streaming-chart-has-arrived-1385/|title=The UK's first Official Streaming Chart has arrived|last=Kreisler|first=Lauren|date=9 May 2012|publisher=Official Charts|accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref> on the Official Charts website, and in music industry trade magazine ''Music Week''.

In April 2015, the UK's first vinyl record chart of the modern era was launched by the Official Charts Company due to 'the huge surge of interest' in the sector. The chart was launched following the growth of the sector in the UK for the seventh year in a row.<ref>{{cite news|title=UK's first official vinyl chart launched as sales rise|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32251994|accessdate=13 April 2015|work=BBC|agency=BBC|date=13 April 2015}}</ref>

In July 2015, Official Charts changed its chart methodology from traditional Sunday slot to the new Friday slot, effective on 10 July 2015<ref>{{cite web|last=Copsey |first=Rob |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/global-release-day-new-music-fridays-and-the-official-chart-to-kick-off-your-weekend-from-next-month__9801/ |title=Global Release Day: Official Chart to kick off your weekend from next month |website=Officialcharts.com |date=2015-06-10 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}</ref> to coincide with the 'New Music Friday - Global Release Day' campaign set by [[IFPI]] which effective on 10 July 2015 as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/news/New-Music-Fridays-are-coming|title="New Music Fridays" are coming - Global release day launches 10th July|publisher=Official Charts}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/NewMusicFridays_FAQ.pdf |format=PDF |title="New Music Fridays" – FAQ for those working in the industry |website=Ifpi.org |accessdate=2017-06-30}}</ref>

Beginning in 2017 the Official Charts Company changed its methodology for calculating the Top 40, intending to more accurately reflect the rise in music streaming. Prior to January 2017, 100 streams counted as one 'sale' of a song. From January onward, the ratio became 150:1.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-38364237 | title = Chart company changes formula to reflect rise in streaming | date= December 19, 2016 | accessdate = January 26, 2017 | publisher = ''BBC News'' | author = Mark Savage }}</ref> Additionally, in June 2017, it was decided that after a record has spent at least 10 weeks on the chart, any track which has declined for three consecutive weeks will see its streams:sales ratio change from 150:1 to 300:1, in an attempt to accelerate their disappearance from the chart.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.musicweek.com/labels/read/official-charts-company-introduces-singles-chart-revamp/068936|title=Official Charts Company introduces singles chart revamp|first=Mark|last=Sutherland|date=27 June 2017|work=Music Week|publisher=Intent Media|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref>
