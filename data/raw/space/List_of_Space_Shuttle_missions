The [[Space Shuttle]] was a partially reusable [[low Earth orbit]]al [[spacecraft]] system operated by the U.S. [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA).  Its official program name was Space Transportation System (STS), taken from a 1969 plan for [[Space Transportation System|a system of reusable spacecraft]] of which it was the only item funded for development.<ref name=intro-taskGroup>{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/taskgrp.html |title=Report of the Space Task Group, 1969 |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref> Operational missions launched numerous [[satellite]]s, conducted science experiments in orbit, and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). The first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981, leading to operational flights beginning in 1982.

From 1981 to 2011 a total of 135 missions were flown, all launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. During that time period the fleet logged 1,322 days, 19 hours, 21 minutes and 23 seconds of flight time.<ref name="intro-ShuttleByNumbers">{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/12376-nasa-space-shuttle-program-facts-statistics.html | title=NASA's Space Shuttle By the Numbers: 30 Years of a Spaceflight Icon | publisher=[[Space.com]] | date=21 July 2011 | accessdate=18 June 2014 | author=Malik, Tarik}}</ref> The longest orbital flight of the shuttle was [[STS-80]] at 17 days 15 hours, while the shortest flight was [[STS-51-L]] at one minute 13 seconds when the Space Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' broke apart during launch. The shuttles docked with Russian space station ''[[Mir]]'' nine times and visited the ISS thirty-seven times. The highest altitude (apogee) achieved by the shuttle was 350 miles when servicing the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].<ref name="intro-forbes">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2012/04/18/5-horrifying-facts-you-didnt-know-about-the-space-shuttle/2/ |title=5 Horrifying Facts You Didn't Know About the Space Shuttle |author=Pinchefsky, Carol |work=[[Forbes]] |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref>  The program flew a total of 355 people representing 16 countries.<ref name="intro-nasafacts">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/566250main_2011.07.05%20SHUTTLE%20ERA%20FACTS.pdf |title=Space Shuttle Era Facts |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |year=2011 |format=PDF |accessdate=6 January 2015 |id=FS-2011-7-142-KSC}}</ref> The Kennedy Space Center served as the landing site for 78 missions, while 54 missions landed at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]] and 1 mission landed at [[White Sands, New Mexico|White Sands]], [[New Mexico]].<ref name="intro-launch">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/ |title=Space Shuttle Launch and Landing |author1=Ryba, Jeanne |author2=Brian Dunbar |date=11 September 2012 |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref>

The first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built solely for [[Approach and Landing Tests|atmospheric flight tests]] and had no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''Challenger'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. ''Challenger'' and ''Columbia'' were destroyed in mission accidents in 1986 and 2003 respectively, killing a total of fourteen astronauts. A fifth operational orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of [[STS-135]] by ''Atlantis'' on 21 July 2011.{{sfn|Jenkins|p=524}}

The U.S. Space Shuttle program was officially referred to as the Space Transportation System (STS). Specific shuttle missions were therefore designated with the prefix "STS".<ref name="intro-ShuttleByNumbers" /> Initially, the launches were given sequential numbers indicating order of launch, such as [[STS-7]].  Subsequent to the [[Apollo&nbsp;13]] mishap, due to [[NASA Administrator]] [[James&nbsp;M. Beggs]]'s [[triskaidekaphobia]] and consequent unwillingness to number [[STS-41-C|a&nbsp;forthcoming flight]] as STS-13,<ref name="numbering-crippenoh">{{cite web |format=PDF |url = http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/CrippenRL/CrippenRL_5-26-06.pdf |title=Robert L.

After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]], NASA returned to using a sequential numbering system, with the number counting from the beginning of the STS program. Unlike the initial system, however, the numbers were assigned based on the initial mission schedule, and did not always reflect actual launch order. This numbering scheme started at 26, with the first flight as STS-26R—the R suffix stood for "reflight" to disambiguate from prior missions. The suffix was used for two years through STS-33R, then the R was dropped.{{sfn|Jenkins|p=524}} As a result of the changes in systems, flights under different numbering systems could have the same number with one having a letter appended, e.g. flight [[STS-51]] (a mission carried out by [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] in 1993) was many years after [[STS-51-A]] (''Discovery's'' second flight in 1984).{{sfn|Jenkins|p=524}}

===Test flights===
{{main article|Approach and Landing Tests}}
[[File:Enterprise free flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' on one of its five free-flights during the Approach and Landing Test program]]
The Approach and Landing Test Program encompassed 16 separate tests of ''Enterprise'', covering taxi tests, unmanned and manned flights on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], and finally the free flight tests. The following list includes the free-flight tests, durations listed count only the orbiter free-flight time.  The list does not include total time aloft along with airborne time atop of the [[Boeing 747]] [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] (SCA).

==Cancelled missions==
{{main article|Canceled Space Shuttle missions}}
One initial [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Intact abort modes|emergency flight abort (RTLS)]] [[sub-orbital spaceflight|sub-orbital]] test mission was canceled due to high risk. Many other planned missions were canceled due to the late development of the shuttle, and the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'']] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'']] disasters.

Four missions were cut short by a day or more while in orbit: [[STS-2]] (equipment failure),{{sfn|Chen|p=11}} [[STS-35]] (weather),<ref name="sts35-nasaarchive" /> [[STS-44]] (equipment failure),{{sfn|Chen|p=173}} and [[STS-83]] (equipment failure, relaunched as [[STS-94]]).{{sfn|Chen|p=173}}

==Contingency missions==
[[File:Space shuttles Atlantis (STS-125) and Endeavour (STS-400) on launch pads.jpg|thumb|right|''Atlantis'' and ''Endeavour'' on LC-39A and LC-39B. ''Endeavour'' was slated to launch for [[STS-400]] rescue mission should ''Atlantis'' ([[STS-125]]) be found unable to return safely to Earth.]]
{{Main article|STS-3xx}}
[[STS-3xx|STS-300]] was the designation for the [[Space Shuttle]] Launch on Need (LON) missions to be launched on short notice for [[STS-114]] and [[STS-121]], in the event that the shuttle became disabled or damaged and could not safely return to Earth.<ref name="contingency-cscs">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/153444main_CSCS_Resource_%20Book.pdf|title=Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS)/Rescue Flight Resource Book|accessdate=25 November 2008|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=2005|author=NASA|format=pdf}}</ref><ref name="contingency-frr">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/150494main_frr_brief_20060617.pdf|title=Flight Readiness Review Briefing Transcript|accessdate=25 November 2008|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=2005|author=NASA|format=pdf}}</ref><ref name="contingency-cscsNumbers">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/04/nasa-sets-new-launch-date-targets-through-to-sts-124/|title=NASA Sets New Launch Date Targets Through to STS-124 |accessdate=2 September 2010 |publisher=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]] |date=15 April 2007 |first=Chris |last=Bergin |work=CSCS flight numbers}}</ref> The rescue flight for [[STS-115]], if needed, would have been STS-301. After STS-115, the rescue mission designations were based on the corresponding regular mission that would be replaced should the rescue mission be needed. For example, the [[STS-116]] rescue mission was branded STS-317, because the normal mission scheduled after STS-116 was [[STS-117]]. Should the rescue mission have been needed, the crew and vehicle for STS-117 would assume the rescue mission profile and become STS-317. All potential rescue missions were to be launched with a crew of four, and would return with ten or eleven crew members, depending on the number of crew launched on the rescued shuttle. Missions were expected to last approximately eleven days. None of the planned contingency missions was ever flown.<ref name="contingency-sts335">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/05/sts-335-nasa-planning-contingency-launch-on-need-mission/ |title=STS-335: NASA Continues Planning for Contingency Launch On Need Mission |author=Gebhardt, Chris |date= 31 May 2010 |accessdate=29 December 2014 |publisher=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]]}}</ref>

No contingency mission was planned for [[STS-135]], the final shuttle mission.  Instead, NASA planned to effect any required rescues one-by-one, using Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]].<ref name="contingency-abcnews">{{cite news |last=Ned|first=Potter|title=NASA Space Shuttle: Only Four Astronauts on Final Launch From Cape Canaveral |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/nasas-space-shuttle-risky-missions-atlantis-flight/story?id=14030398 |accessdate=8 July 2011 |newspaper=[[ABC News]] |date=8 July 2011}}</ref>
