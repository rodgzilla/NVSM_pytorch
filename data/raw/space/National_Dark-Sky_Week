'''National Dark-Sky Week''' ('''NDSW'''), held during the week of the [[new moon]] in April,<ref name=WG>{{cite web |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-national-dark-sky-week.htm |title=What Is National Dark Sky Week? |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=Wise Geek |publisher=Conjecture Corporation |accessdate=25 December 2013}}</ref> is a week during which people worldwide turn out their lights in order to observe the beauty of the [[night sky]] without [[light pollution]]. This event was founded in 2003 by high school student Jennifer Barlow of [[Midlothian, Virginia]] and its popularity and participation increases every year.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Jennifer Barlow: Dark-sky Devotee - Sky & Telescope|url = http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/jennifer-barlow-dark-sky-devotee/|website = Sky & Telescope|accessdate = 2015-12-06|language = en-US}}</ref> It has been endorsed by the [[International Dark-Sky Association]] (IDA), the [[American Astronomical Society]] (AAS), the [[Astronomical League]], and ''[[Sky & Telescope]]'' (''S&T'').<ref name="S&T">{{cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/resources/darksky/3307451.html |title=Jennifer Barlow: Dark-sky Devotee |last=Bobra |first=Monica |work=[[Sky & Telescope]] |publisher=Sky Publishing of New Track Media}}</ref>

==Goal==
The goals of the event are to:
* Temporarily reduce light pollution and raise awareness about its effects on the night sky,
* Encourage the use of better lighting systems that direct light downward instead of into the sky, and
* Promote the study of [[astronomy]].

This event always occurs in April, during the week of the new moon so that the sky can be as dark as possible for optimum viewing conditions.

Jennifer Barlow states, "The night sky is a gift of such tremendous beauty that should not be hidden under a blanket of wasted light. It should be visible so that future generations do not lose touch with the wonder of our [[universe]]." Barlow explains, "It is my wish that people see the night sky in all of its glory, without excess light in the sky as our ancestors saw it hundreds of years ago."<ref name="S&T"/>

==Participation==
Willing participants in this project turn off all unnecessary lighting indoors and outdoors sources in order to reduce light pollution of the night sky.

The International Dark-sky Association encourages light
users to take precautions against outdoor light pollution by:<ref>{{Cite web|title = Outdoor Lighting Basics|url = http://darksky.org/lighting/lighting-basics/|website = International Dark-Sky Association|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}</ref>

* Using outdoor light only when needed
*Confine light to specific areas 
*Be aware that lights need only be as bright as it is necessary
*Reducing the amount of [[Visible spectrum|blue light]] emissions used
*Use of lighting that faces downward, in order to avoid over illumination, called [[fully shielded fixtures]]

==Types of light pollution==
[[Light pollution]] is a broad term used to define excess artificial light that brightens the night sky. Types of light pollution which include:
* [[Skyglow]], a hazy glow produced by the reflection water molecules in the air that encompasses cities which prevent the night sky to be fully seen.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What is sky glow? {{!}} Light Pollution {{!}} Lighting Answers {{!}} NLPIP|url = http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightinganswers/lightpollution/skyGlow.asp|website = www.lrc.rpi.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}</ref> 
* [[Light trespass]] is a condition in which light is oriented into areas in which it is not needed. A common example is street lighting projecting in all directions including the sky which creates a hazy reflection upon the night sky, making it difficult for star observation.<ref name="physics.fau.edu">{{Cite web|title = Light Pollution Impacts Animals and Environment|url = http://physics.fau.edu/observatory/lightpol-environ.html|website = physics.fau.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}</ref> 
* [[Over-illumination]] is the excess supply of light used beyond what is necessary for safety and efficiency. 
* [[Light clutter]] which refers to the common organizational groupings of lights in cities and roadways. 
* [[Glare (vision)|Glare]] is an impeding bright light which cause temporary impairments to human sight. There are three classifications of glare, blinding glare, disability glare and discomfort glare. (See [[Light pollution]])

==Implications of light pollution==
[[Light pollution]] is the adverse effects of artificial light.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Light Pollution Impacts Animals and Environment|url = http://physics.fau.edu/observatory/lightpol-environ.html|website = physics.fau.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}</ref>

Affected parties of light pollution include:<ref name="Chepesiuk A20-A27">{{Cite journal|title = Missing the Dark: Health Effects of Light Pollution|journal = Environmental Health Perspectives|date = 2009-01-01|issn = 0091-6765|pmc = 2627884|pmid = 19165374|pages = A20-A27|volume = 117|issue = 1|first = Ron|last = Chepesiuk|doi=10.1289/ehp.117-a20}}</ref>

'''Astronomers:'''

By increasing the number of participants, the quality of viewing the sky and stars will be temporarily improved. This is a benefit to astronomers that are faced with light pollution issues such as [[light trespass]] and [[skyglow]].<ref name="physics.fau.edu"/>

'''Nocturnal wildlife:'''<br>Several animal species have been documented to be affected by light pollution. The glare of street lights cause distraction to nocturnal birds in flight leading to bird crashes into sky scrapers and buildings. The use of light may also cause birds to reproduce or migrate too early. The feeding behavior of insects, bats, sea turtles, fish, replies reflect alterations by artificial light. Sea turtles mistake the glow of electric lights for the shimmer of the ocean, leading them to flock outside of their nest into hazardous areas.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Light Pollution Effects on Wildlife and Ecosystems|url = http://darksky.org/light-pollution/wildlife/|website = International Dark-Sky Association|accessdate = 2015-12-07|language = en-US}}</ref>

'''Human circadian rhythm and sleep patterns:'''

Exposure to light during traditional sleeping hours have are
documented to cause disruptions in the circadian rhythm that regulate human
sleep cycles.<ref name="Chepesiuk A20-A27"/> Biologists have noted a decrease in the amount of [[melatonin]], a natural hormone that regulates the [[Circadian rhythm]], in humans that are exposed to light pollution of the night sky.<ref name="Human Health">{{Cite web|title = Human Health|url = http://darksky.org/light-pollution/human-health/|website = International Dark-Sky Association|accessdate = 2015-12-07|language = en-US}}</ref> In order to prevent major impact, biologists suggest to increase the amount of natural light exposure during the day and decrease the amount of electrical light consumed at night.<ref name="Human Health"/>

'''Growth patterns of plants and trees:'''

The growing pattern of trees have been disrupted and less adjusted to seasonal
changes in weather and light exposure.<ref name="Chepesiuk A20-A27"/>

'''Waste of economic resources:'''

Leaving lights on that are not in use can lead to the waste of economic cost expenditures. Conservation and efficiency is necessary for environmental responsibility.<ref name="Chepesiuk A20-A27" /> The invention of LED lights, dimmers, motion sensors and times have reduced the amount of energy used.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Light Pollution Wastes Energy and Money|url = http://darksky.org/light-pollution/energy-waste/|website = International Dark-Sky Association|accessdate = 2015-12-07|language = en-US}}</ref>

==Legislation==
The best way to take action to promote dark skies is to get involved in local government. There are templates for [[light ordinances]] that can legally ban the use of harmful lights and limit commercial lighting to a specific curfew. Currently, there are no nationwide standards regarding light pollution. However, select cities across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] are taking initiative to facilitate dark sky cities in order to reduce light pollution and view the night sky within city limits.
