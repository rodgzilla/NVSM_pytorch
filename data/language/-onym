The [[suffix]] '''''-onym''''', in [[English language|English]] and other languages, means "word, name", and [[word]]s ending in ''-onym'' refer to a specified kind of name or word, most of which are [[classical compound]]s. For example, an [[acronym]] is a word formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound term (as [[radar]]). The use of ''-onym'' words provides a means of classifying, often to a fine degree of resolution, sets of nouns with common attributes.

In some words, the ''-onym'' form has been modified by replacing (or dropping) the "o". In the examples ''[[ananym]]'' and ''[[metanym]]'', the correct forms (''[[anonym]]'' and ''[[metonym]]'') were pre-occupied by other meanings. Other, late 20th century examples, such as ''[[hypernym]]'' and ''[[characternym]]'', are typically incorrectly formed [[neologism]]s for which there are more traditional words formed in ''-onym'' (''[[hyperonym]]'' and ''[[charactonym]]'').

The English suffix ''-onym'' is from the [[Ancient Greek]] suffix {{lang|grc|-ώνυμον}} (''ōnymon''), neuter of the suffix {{lang|grc|ώνυμος}} (''ōnymos''), having a specified kind of name, from the Greek {{lang|grc|ὄνομα}} (''ónoma''), [[Aeolic Greek]] ὄνυμα (''ónyma''), "name". The form ''-ōnymos'' is that taken by ''ónoma'' when it is the end component of a [[bahuvrihi]] compound, but in English its use is extended to [[tatpurusa]] compounds.

The suffix is found in many modern languages with various spellings. Examples are: [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''synoniem'', [[German language|German]] ''Synonym'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''sinónimo'', [[Russian language|Russian]] синоним (''sinonim''), [[Polish language|Polish]] ''synonim'', [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''synonyymi'', [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''sinonim''.

According to a 1988 study<ref>Scheetz, ''Names' Names,'' p. 1</ref> of words ending in ''-onym'', there are four discernible classes of ''-onym'' words: (1) historic, classic, or, for want of better terms, naturally occurring or common words; (2) scientific terminology, occurring in particular in linguistics, onomastics, etc.; (3) language games; and (4) [[nonce word]]s. Older terms are known to gain new, sometimes contradictory, meanings (e.g., ''eponym'' and ''cryptonym''). In many cases, two or more words describe the same phenomenon, but no precedence is discernible (e.g., ''necronym'' and ''penthonym''). New words are sometimes created, the meaning of which duplicating existing terms. On occasion, new words are formed with little regard to historical principles.
