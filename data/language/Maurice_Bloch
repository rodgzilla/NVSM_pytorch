'''Maurice Bloch''' (born 1939 in [[Caen]], [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], [[France]]) is a British [[anthropologist]]. His widowed mother remarried an Englishman, and moved with her son to England when he was eleven. He did all of his college and graduate work there, and has had most of his academic career at the [[London School of Economics]], where he was made full professor in 1983.

==Early life and education==
Maurice Bloch was born in Caen, Calvados, to Jewish parents Claudette (née Raphael), a marine biologist, and Pierre Bloch, an engineer. His grandmother was a niece of sociologist [[Emile Durkheim]] and a much younger first cousin of anthropologist [[Marcel Mauss]].<ref>[http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/ancestors/bloch.htm "Interview of Maurice Bloch"]: Maurice Bloch interviewed by Alan Macfarlane on 29 May 2008</ref> Maurice attended the [[Lycée Carnot]] in [[Paris]]. His father was killed by the Nazis while in the French Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2008-02-28-bloch-en.html |title=The reluctant anthropologist - Maurice Bloch, Maarja Kaaristo An interview with Maurice Bloch |publisher=Eurozine |date= |accessdate=2013-03-27}}</ref> When Maurice was eleven, his widowed mother married British biologist [[J.S. Kennedy|John S. Kennedy]], whom she had met at a conference. She and her son moved to England to join Kennedy, and Bloch became a British citizen, attending [[The Perse School]] in Cambridge. 

He studied as an undergraduate at the [[London School of Economics]], attending lectures at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]]. He continued his training in anthropology at [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge]], where he obtained his doctorate in 1967.<ref>''Optima: Fitzwilliam College Newsletter'', Issue 21, Summer 2015 (p. 2)</ref>

==Career==
His subsequent career has been almost entirely at the London School of Economics, where he was appointed a full professor in 1983.

In 2005 Bloch was appointed European Professor at the [[Collège de France]].<ref>[http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/his_cheur/maurice_bloch.htm "Maurice Bloch"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217095656/http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/his_cheur/maurice_bloch.htm |date=17 February 2010 }}</ref> He was until 2009 visiting Professor at the [[Free University of Amsterdam]]. He has taught and has been an occasional visiting professor in most European countries, as well as Japan. In the US, he was a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] in Baltimore, and at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. At present, he is Emeritus Professor at the [[London School of Economics]] and an associate member of the [[Institut Jean Nicod]] of the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris.

He has supervised many younger anthropologists, several of whom hold prestigious posts in the UK, US, Australia, Japan, France, Canada, the Netherlands, China, Argentina, Madagascar and Malaysia. His writings have been translated into at least twelve languages.

In 1990, Bloch was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/ordinary.cfm?letter=B |accessdate=4 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606095530/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/ordinary.cfm?letter=B |archivedate=6 June 2011 }}</ref>

==Research==
Bloch's field research has been mainly carried out in two different areas of [[Madagascar]]. One field site has been among the peasants of central [[Imerina]]; and the other in a remote forest inhabited by a group of people called [[Zafimaniry]]. His writing deals with religion, kinship, economics, politics and language. His research has been much influenced by French [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideas.

He has been an innovator in relating social anthropology to [[linguistics]] and [[cognitive psychology]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/DO/filmshow/bloch_lecture_fast.htm |title=lecture |publisher=Alanmacfarlane.com |date=2008-05-29 |accessdate=2013-03-27}}</ref> Much of his theoretical work since the 1970s has concerned the interface between cognition and social and cultural life. What he has written on this subject faces two ways: on the one hand, he criticises anthropologists for exaggerating the particularity of specific cultures; on the other hand, he criticises cognitive scientists for underestimating it.

He has published more than a hundred articles and many books,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Maurice-Bloch/e/B001IZTDTU |title=Maurice Bloch: Books, Biogs, Audiobooks, Discussions |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-27}}</ref> half of which concern Madagascar in some way.
