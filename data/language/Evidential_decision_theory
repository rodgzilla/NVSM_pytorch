'''Evidential decision theory''' is a school of thought within [[decision theory]] according to which the best action is the one which, conditional on one's having chosen it, gives one the best expectations for the outcome. It contrasts with [[causal decision theory]], which requires a causal connection between one's actions and the desirable outcome.

==Description==

In a 1981 article, Allan Gibbard and William Harper characterized evidential decision theory as maximization of the [[expected utility]] <math>V</math> of an action <math>A</math> "calculated from conditional probabilities":<ref name="GibbardHarper">{{Citation

:<math>
V(A)=\sum\limits_{j} P(O_j | A) D(O_j),
</math>
where <math>D(O_j)</math> is the desirability of outcome <math>O_j</math> and <math>P(O_j | A)</math> is the [[conditional probability]] of <math>O_j</math> given <math>A</math>.

==Criticism==

[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] has characterized evidential decision theory as promoting "an irrational 
policy of managing the news".<ref name=Lewis1981>{{Citation
