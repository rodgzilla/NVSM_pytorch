The evolutionary emergence of language in the [[human|human species]] has been a subject of speculation for several centuries. The topic is difficult to study because of the lack of direct evidence. Consequently, scholars wishing to study the origins of language must draw inferences from other kinds of evidence such as the [[human evolution|fossil record]], archaeological evidence, contemporary language diversity, studies of [[language acquisition]], and comparisons between human [[language]] and systems of communication existing [[Animal communication|among animals]] (particularly [[Great ape language|other primates]]). Many argue that the origins of language probably relate closely to the origins of [[behavioral modernity|modern human behavior]], but there is little agreement about the implications and directionality of this connection.

This shortage of [[empirical evidence]] has led many scholars to regard the entire topic as unsuitable for serious study. In 1866, the [[Linguistic Society of Paris]] banned any existing or future debates on the subject, a prohibition which remained influential across much of the Western world until late in the twentieth century.<ref>Stam, J.

* "Continuity theories" built on the idea that language exhibits so much complexity that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form; therefore it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our primate ancestors. 
* "Discontinuity theories" take the opposite approach—that language, as a unique trait which cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans, must have appeared fairly suddenly during the course of [[human evolution]]. 
* Some theories see language mostly as an [[innate]] faculty—largely genetically encoded.
* Other theories regard language as a mainly [[cultural]] system—learned through social interaction.

[[Noam Chomsky]], a prominent proponent of discontinuity theory, argues that a single chance mutation occurred in one individual in the order of 100,000 years ago, installing the language faculty (a component of the mid-brain) in "perfect" or "near-perfect" form.<ref>Chomsky, N, 1996. ''Powers and Prospects. Reflections on human nature and the social order.'' London: Pluto Press, p 30.</ref> 
A majority of linguistic scholars {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}} hold continuity-based theories, but they vary in how they envision language development. Among those who see language as mostly innate, some—notably [[Steven Pinker]]<ref name="Pinker 1990">{{cite journal | last1 = Pinker | first1 = S. | last2 = Bloom | first2 = P. | year = 1990 | title = Natural language and natural selection | url = http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/04/99/index.html | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 707–784 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00081061 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051123085422/http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/04/99/index.html | archivedate = 2005-11-23 | df =  }}</ref>—avoid speculating about specific precursors in nonhuman primates, stressing simply that the language faculty must have evolved in the usual gradual way.<ref name="Pinker 1994">

Because the [[emergence]] of language lies so far back in [[human prehistory]], the relevant developments have left no direct historical traces; neither can comparable processes be observed today.

The time range for the evolution of language and/or its anatomical prerequisites extends, at least in principle, from the phylogenetic divergence of ''[[Homo]]'' (2.3 to 2.4 million years ago) from ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]'' (5 to 6 million years ago) to the emergence of full [[behavioral modernity]] some 50,000–150,000 years ago. Few dispute that ''[[Australopithecus]]'' probably lacked vocal communication significantly more sophisticated than that of [[great ape]]s in general,<ref name="Arcadi 2000">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Arcadi | first1 = AC. | title = Vocal responsiveness in male wild chimpanzees: implications for the evolution of language. | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–23 |date=Aug 2000 | doi = 10.1006/jhev.2000.0415 | pmid = 10968929 }}</ref> but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (''[[proto-language]]'') as early as ''[[Homo habilis]]'', while others place the development of [[symbolic communication]] only with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million years ago) or with ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (0.6 million years ago) and the development of language proper with ''[[Homo sapiens]],'' currently estimated at less than 200,000 years ago.

Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages, [[Johanna Nichols]]—a linguist at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]—argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in our species at least 100,000 years ago.<ref>Johanna Nichols, 1998.

Atkinson<ref name="Atkinson 2011"/> suggests that successive population bottlenecks occurred as our African ancestors migrated to other areas, leading to a decrease in genetic and phenotypic diversity. Atkinson argues that these bottlenecks also affected culture and language, suggesting that the further away a particular language is from Africa, the fewer [[phonemes]] it contains. By way of evidence, Atkinson claims that today's African languages tend to have relatively large numbers of phonemes, whereas languages from areas in [[Oceania]] (the last place to which humans migrated), have relatively few.  Relying heavily on Atkinson's work, a subsequent study has explored the rate at which phonemes develop naturally, comparing this rate to some of Africa's oldest languages. The results suggest that language first evolved around 50,000–150,000 years ago, which is around the time when modern ''Homo sapiens'' evolved.<ref name="Perreault 2012">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35289 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 | pmid = 22558135 | pmc = 3338724| bibcode = 2012PLoSO...735289P }}</ref> Estimates of this kind are not universally accepted, but jointly considering genetic, archaeological, palaeontological and much other evidence indicates that language probably emerged somewhere in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] during the [[Middle Stone Age]], roughly contemporaneous with the speciation of ''Homo sapiens.''<ref name="Botha 2009">

==Language origin hypotheses==

===Early speculations===
{{quotation|I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries.|Charles Darwin, 1871. ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex''<ref>Darwin, C. (1871). "The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, 2 vols. London: Murray, p. 56.</ref>}} In 1861, historical linguist [[Max Müller]] published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language:<ref>Müller, F. M. 1996 [1861]. The theoretical stage, and the origin of language. Lecture 9 from Lectures on the Science of Language. Reprinted in R. Harris (ed.), ''The Origin of Language.'' Bristol: Thoemmes Press, pp. 7–41.</ref>

* '''Bow-wow'''. The ''bow-wow'' or ''cuckoo'' theory, which Müller attributed to the German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], saw early words as imitations of the cries of beasts and birds.
* '''Pooh-pooh'''. The ''pooh-pooh'' theory saw the [[Interjectional theory|first words as emotional interjections and exclamations]] triggered by pain, pleasure, surprise, etc.
* '''Ding-dong'''. Müller suggested what he called the ''ding-dong'' theory, which states that all things have a vibrating natural resonance, echoed somehow by man in his earliest words.
* '''Yo-he-ho'''. The ''yo-he-ho'' theory claims language emerged from collective rhythmic labor, the attempt to synchronize muscular effort resulting in sounds such as ''heave'' alternating with sounds such as ''ho.''
* '''Ta-ta'''. This did not feature in Max Müller's list, having been proposed in 1930 by Sir Richard Paget.<ref>Paget, R. 1930. ''Human speech: some observations, experiments, and conclusions as to the nature, origin, purpose and possible improvement of human speech.'' London: Routledge & Kegan Paul.</ref> According to the ''ta-ta'' theory, humans made the earliest words by tongue movements that mimicked manual gestures, rendering them audible.

Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong—they occasionally offer peripheral insights—as naïve and irrelevant.<ref>Firth, J. R. 1964. ''The Tongues of Men and Speech.'' London: Oxford University Press, pp. 25–6.</ref><ref>Stam, J. H. 1976. ''Inquiries into the origins of language.'' New York: Harper and Row, p. 243-44.</ref> The problem with these theories is that they are so narrowly mechanistic.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} They assume that once our ancestors had stumbled upon the appropriate ingenious ''mechanism'' for linking sounds with meanings, language automatically evolved and changed.

===Problems of reliability and deception===
{{further|Signalling theory}}

From the perspective of signalling theory, the main obstacle to the evolution of language-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is the fact that symbols—arbitrary associations of sounds or other perceptible forms with corresponding meanings—are unreliable and may well be false.<ref name="Zahavi 1993">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = The fallacy of conventional signalling. | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 340 | issue = 1292 | pages = 227–230 |date=May 1993 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1993.0061 | pmid = 8101657 }}</ref> As the saying goes, "words are cheap".<ref name="Smith 1994">{{cite journal| last1=Smith| first1=J.Maynard|title=Must reliable signals always be costly?|journal=Animal Behaviour| volume=47|issue=5|year=1994|pages=1115–1120|issn=0003-3472|doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1149}}</ref> The problem of reliability was not recognized at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionary theorists.

Animal vocal signals are, for the most part, intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state. We trust the signal, not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just cannot fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable, but they remain reliable for the same reason—because they are hard to fake.<ref name="Goodall 1986">{{Cite book  | last1 = Goodall | first1 = Jane | title = The chimpanzees of Gombe : patterns of behavior | year = 1986 | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-11649-8 | oclc = 12550961 }}</ref> Primate social intelligence is "[[Machiavellian]]"—self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples.

Words automatically fail this test.<ref name="Knight 1998"/>

Words are easy to fake. Should they turn out to be lies, listeners will adapt by ignoring them in favor of hard-to-fake indices or cues. For language to work, then, listeners must be confident that those with whom they are on speaking terms are generally likely to be honest.<ref name="Power 1998">{{Cite book| last1 =  Power| first1 =  Camilla|title = Old wives' tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 111–129}}</ref> A peculiar feature of language is "[[displacement (linguistics)|displaced reference]]", which means reference to topics outside the currently perceptible situation. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate "here" and "now". For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. This stability is born of a longstanding mutual trust and is what grants language its authority. A theory of the origins of language must therefore explain why humans could begin trusting cheap signals in ways that other animals apparently cannot (see [[signalling theory]]).

Fitch suggests that languages were originally 'mother tongues'. If language evolved initially for communication between mothers and their own biological offspring, extending later to include adult relatives as well, the interests of speakers and listeners would have tended to coincide. Fitch argues that shared genetic interests would have led to sufficient trust and cooperation for intrinsically unreliable signals—words—to become accepted as trustworthy and so begin evolving for the first time.

Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans.<ref name="Tallerman 2013">{{Cite book  | last1 = Tallerman | first1 = Maggie| title = Kin selection, pedagogy and linguistic complexity: whence protolanguage? | editors =  Rudolf P Botha, Martin Everaert| work = The evolutionary emergence of language : evidence and inference | year = 2013 | publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = Oxford, UK | isbn = 978-0-19-965485-7 | oclc = 856795812| pages = 77–96  }}</ref> So even if one accepts Fitch's initial premises, the extension of the posited 'mother tongue' networks from close relatives to more distant relatives remains unexplained.<ref name="Tallerman 2013"/> Fitch argues, however, that the extended period of physical immaturity of human infants and the postnatal [[encephalization|growth of the human brain]] give the human-infant relationship a different and more extended period of intergenerational dependency than that found in any other species.<ref name="Fitch 2004"/>

====The 'obligatory reciprocal altruism' hypothesis====
Ib Ulbæk<ref name="Ulbæk 1998"/> invokes another standard Darwinian principle—'[[reciprocal altruism]]'<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R. L. | year = 1971 | title = The evolution of reciprocal altruism | url = | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 35–57 | doi=10.1086/406755}}</ref>—to explain the unusually high levels of intentional honesty necessary for language to evolve. 'Reciprocal altruism' can be expressed as the principle that ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours''. In linguistic terms, it would mean that ''if you speak truthfully to me, I'll speak truthfully to you''. Ordinary Darwinian reciprocal altruism, Ulbæk points out, is a relationship established between frequently interacting individuals. For language to prevail across an entire community, however, the necessary reciprocity would have needed to be enforced universally instead of being left to individual choice. Ulbæk concludes that for language to evolve, society as a whole must have been subject to moral regulation.

Critics point out that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom 'obligatory reciprocal altruism' could possibly have been enforced.<ref name="Knight 2006"/> Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect.<ref name="Knight 2006"/> A further criticism is that language doesn't work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups don't withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to [[Signalling theory|advertise to the world]] their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting that information without expectation of reciprocity to anyone who will listen.<ref name="Dessalles 1998">{{Cite book| last1 =  Dessalles| first1 =  Jean L. |title = Altruism, status and the origin of relevance|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 130–147}}</ref>

====The gossip and grooming hypothesis====

Gossip, according to [[Robin Dunbar]] in his book ''[[Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language]]'', does for group-living humans what [[social grooming|manual grooming]] does for other primates—it allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances on the basis of the principle: ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours''. Dunbar argues that as humans began living in increasingly larger social groups, the task of manually grooming all one's friends and acquaintances became so time-consuming as to be unaffordable.<ref name="Dunbar 1996">{{cite book | last = Dunbar | first = R. I. M. | title = Grooming, gossip and the evolution of language | publisher = Faber and Faber | location = London | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780571173969 |oclc = 34546743}}</ref> In response to this problem, humans developed 'a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming'—''vocal grooming''. To keep allies happy, one now needs only to 'groom' them with low-cost vocal sounds, servicing multiple allies simultaneously while keeping both hands free for other tasks. Vocal grooming then evolved gradually into vocal language—initially in the form of 'gossip'.<ref name="Dunbar 1996"/> Dunbar's hypothesis seems to be supported by the fact that the structure of language shows adaptations to the function of narration in general.<ref>{{cite book|author=von Heiseler, Till Nikolaus|year=2014|contribution=Language evolved for storytelling in a super-fast evolution|editor=R. L. C.

Critics of this theory point out that the very efficiency of 'vocal grooming'—the fact that words are so cheap—would have undermined its capacity to signal commitment of the kind conveyed by time-consuming and costly manual grooming.<ref>{{cite book|author=Power, C.|year=1998|contribution=Old wives' tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals|editor=J.

====Ritual/speech coevolution====
The ritual/speech coevolution theory was originally proposed by social anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]]<ref name="Rappaport 1999"/> before being elaborated by anthropologists such as Chris Knight,<ref name="Knight 1998"/> Jerome Lewis,<ref name="Lewis 2009">{{Cite book| last1 = Lewis| first1 = Jerome| title = As Well as Words: Congo Pygmy Hunting, Mimicry, and Play,| editors = Rudolf P Botha; Chris Knight| work = The cradle of language | year = 2009 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5| oclc = 804498749| pages = 236–256 }}</ref> Nick Enfield,<ref name="Enfield 2010">{{cite journal | last1 = Enfield | first1 = N.

These scholars argue that there can be no such thing as a 'theory of the origins of language'. This is because language is not a separate adaptation but an internal aspect of something much wider—namely, human [[symbolic culture]] as a whole.<ref name="Knight 2010"/> Attempts to explain language independently of this wider context have spectacularly failed, say these scientists, because they are addressing a problem with no solution. Can we imagine a historian attempting to explain the emergence of credit cards independently of the wider system of which they are a part? Using a credit card makes sense only if you have a bank account institutionally recognized within a certain kind of advanced capitalist society—one where electronic communications technology and digital computers have already been invented and fraud can be detected and prevented. In much the same way, language would not work outside a specific array of social mechanisms and institutions. For example, it would not work for a nonhuman ape communicating with others in the wild. Not even the cleverest nonhuman ape could make language work under such conditions.

As digital hallucinations{{Clarification needed|date=May 2018}}, they are intrinsically unreliable. Should an especially clever nonhuman ape, or even a group of articulate nonhuman apes, try to use words in the wild, they would carry no conviction. The primate vocalizations that do carry conviction—those they actually use—are unlike words, in that they are emotionally expressive, intrinsically meaningful and reliable because they are relatively costly and hard to fake.

Language consists of digital contrasts whose cost is essentially zero. As pure social conventions, signals of this kind cannot evolve in a Darwinian social world — they are a theoretical impossibility.<ref name="Zahavi 1993"/> Being intrinsically unreliable, language works only if you can build up a reputation for trustworthiness within a certain kind of society—namely, one where symbolic cultural facts (sometimes called 'institutional facts') can be established and maintained through collective social endorsement.<ref>Searle, J. R. 1996. ''The Construction of Social Reality''. London: Penguin.</ref> In any hunter-gatherer society, the basic mechanism for establishing trust in symbolic cultural facts is collective ''ritual''.<ref>Durkheim, E. 1947 [1915]. "Origins of these beliefs". Chapter VII. In É. Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life: A study in religious sociology''. Trans. J. W. Swain. Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, pp. 205–239.</ref> Therefore, the task facing researchers into the origins of language is more multidisciplinary than is usually supposed. It involves addressing the evolutionary emergence of human symbolic culture as a whole, with language an important but subsidiary component.

Critics of the theory include Noam Chomsky, who terms it the 'non-existence' hypothesis—a denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15475441.2011.584041 |title=Language and Other Cognitive Systems.

===Tool culture resilience and grammar in early Homo===

While it is possible to imitate the making of tools like those made by early Homo under circumstances of demonstration, research on primate tool cultures show that non-verbal cultures are vulnerable to environmental change. In particular, if the environment in which a skill can be used disappears for a longer period of time than an individual ape's or early human's lifespan, the skill will be lost if the culture is imitative and non-verbal. Chimpanzees, macaques and capuchin monkeys are all known to lose tool techniques under such circumstances. Researchers on primate culture vulnerability therefore argue that since early Homo species as far back as Homo habilis retained their tool cultures despite many climate change cycles at the timescales of centuries to millennia each, these species had sufficiently developed language abilities to verbally describe complete procedures, and therefore grammar and not only two-word "proto-language".<ref>The multiple roles of cultural transmission experiments in understanding human cultural evolution, Alex Mesoudi, Andrew Whiten</ref><ref>Chimpanzee Material Culture: Implications for Human Evolution, William Clement McGrew</ref>

The theory that early Homo species had sufficiently developed brains for grammar is also supported by researchers who study brain development in children, noting that grammar is developed while connections across the brain are still significantly lower than adult level. These researchers argue that these lowered system requirements for grammatical language make it plausible that the genus Homo had grammar at connection levels in the brain that were significantly lower than those of Homo sapiens and that more recent steps in the evolution of the human brain were not about language.<ref>New Frontiers in Language Evolution and Development: Introduction to the topics Volume, D. Kimbrough Oller, Rick Dale, Ulrike Griebel</ref><ref>Birdsong, speech, and language: exploring the evolution of mind and brain, JJ Bolhuis, M Everaert</ref>

===Structuralist theory===

[[Structural linguistics]] is an approach to the study of language founded by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and popularised through his posthumously published book ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' (1916).

According to [[Structural anthropology|structural anthropologist]] [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], language and meaning—in opposition to "knowledge, which develops slowly and progressively"—must have appeared in an instant:

<blockquote>Whatever may have been the moment and the circumstances of its appearance in the ascent of animal life, language can only have arisen all at once. Things cannot have begun to signify gradually. In the wake of a transformation which is not a subject of study for the social sciences, but for biology and psychology, a shift occurred from a stage when nothing had a meaning to another stage when everything had meaning.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lévi-Strauss |first1=Claude |title=Introduction to the work of Marcel Mauss |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd |isbn=0-7100-9066-8 |pages=59–60}}</ref></blockquote>

Lévi-Strauss's hypothesis is a necessary consequence of Saussure's view of language as a formal system of differential elements: if a signifier only acquires meaning through its difference from other signifiers, then a hypothetical "first signifier" always already implies another signifier ("everything else" or "the rest of the universe") from which the first signifier is different. Thus, language, according to [[structuralism]], must have appeared all at once and not gradually since a semi-language is impossible.

===Chomsky's single step theory===

According to Chomsky's single mutation theory, the emergence of language resembled the formation of a crystal; with [[digital infinity]] as the [[seed crystal]] in a super-saturated primate brain, on the verge of blossoming into the human mind, by physical law, once [[Universal Darwinism|evolution]] added a single small but crucial keystone.<ref>Chomsky, N. (2004). ''Language and Mind: Current thoughts on ancient problems.'' Part I & Part II. In Lyle Jenkins (ed.), ''Variation and Universals in Biolinguistics.'' Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 379–405.</ref><ref name="Three factors in language design">{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N. | year = 2005 | title = Three factors in language design | url = | journal = Linguistic Inquiry | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 1–22 | doi=10.1162/0024389052993655}}</ref> Whilst some suggest it follows from this theory that language appeared rather suddenly within the history of human evolution, Chomsky, writing with computational linguist and computer scientist Robert C. Berwick, suggests it is completely compatible with modern biology. They note "none of the recent accounts of human language evolution seem to have completely grasped the shift from conventional Darwinism to its fully [[stochastic]] modern version—specifically, that there are stochastic effects not only due to sampling like directionless drift, but also due to directed stochastic variation in fitness, migration, and heritability—indeed, all the "forces" that affect individual or gene frequencies. ...  All this can affect evolutionary outcomes—outcomes that as far as we can make out are not brought out in recent books on the evolution of language, yet would arise immediately in the case of any new genetic or individual innovation, precisely the kind of scenario likely to be in play when talking about language's emergence."

Citing evolutionary geneticist [[Svante Pääbo]] they concur that a substantial difference must have occurred to differentiate ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' from [[Neanderthal]]s to "prompt the relentless spread of our species who had never crossed open water up and out of Africa and then on across the entire planet in just a few tens of thousands of years. ... What we do not see is any kind of "gradualism" in new tool technologies or innovations like fire, shelters, or figurative art." Berwick and Chomsky therefore suggest language emerged approximately between 200,000 years ago and 60,000 years ago (between the arrival of the first anatomically modern humans in southern Africa, and the last exodus from Africa, respectively). "That leaves us with about 130,000 years, or approximately 5,000–6,000 generations of time for evolutionary change. This is not 'overnight in one generation' as some have (incorrectly) inferred—but neither is it on the scale of geological eons. It's time enough—within the ballpark for what Nilsson and Pelger (1994) estimated as the time required for the full evolution of a [[vertebrate]] eye from a single cell, even without the invocation of any 'evo-devo' effects."<ref name="Berwick and Chomsky 2016">{{cite book | last = Berwick | first = Robert | last2 = Chomsky |first2= Noam | title = Why Only Us: Language and Evolution | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780262034241 | oclc = 934433881}}</ref>

===Gestural theory===
The gestural theory states that human language developed from [[gesture]]s that were used for simple communication.

Two types of evidence support this theory.
# Gestural language and vocal language depend on similar neural systems. The regions on the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] that are responsible for mouth and hand movements border each other.
# Nonhuman [[primates]] can use gestures or symbols for at least primitive communication, and some of their gestures resemble those of humans, such as the "begging posture", with the hands stretched out, which humans share with chimpanzees.<ref>Premack, David & Premack, Ann James. ''The Mind of an Ape'', {{ISBN|0-393-01581-5}}.</ref>

Research has found strong support for the idea that [[oral communication|verbal language]] and sign language depend on similar neural structures. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-[[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] [[lesion]], showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language.<ref name="Kimura 1993">{{Cite book  | last1 = Kimura | first1 = Doreen. | title = Neuromotor mechanisms in human communication | year = 1993 | publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-505492-7 | oclc = 26396505 }}</ref> Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=A Critical Period for Right Hemisphere Recruitment in American Sign Language Processing |author=Newman, A.

Primate gesture is at least partially genetic: different nonhuman apes will perform gestures characteristic of their species, even if they have never seen another ape perform that gesture. For example, gorillas beat their breasts. This shows that gestures are an intrinsic and important part of primate communication, which supports the idea that language evolved from gesture.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |author=Arbib MA, Liebal K, Pika S |title=Primate vocalization, gesture, and the evolution of human language |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=1053–63; discussion 1063–76 |date=December 2008  |pmid=19391445 |doi=10.1086/593015|last2=Liebal |last3=Pika }}</ref>

Further evidence suggests that gesture and language are linked. In humans, manually gesturing has an effect on concurrent vocalizations, thus creating certain natural vocal associations of manual efforts. Chimpanzees move their mouths when performing fine motor tasks. These mechanisms may have played an evolutionary role in enabling the development of intentional vocal communication as a supplement to gestural communication. Voice modulation could have been prompted by preexisting manual actions.<ref name=":0" />

There is also the fact that, from infancy, gestures both supplement and predict speech.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2004/015) |pmid=15072537 |title=Gesture Development |journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=173–86 |year=2004 |last1=Capone |first1=Nina C. |last2=McGregor |first2=Karla K. }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ozçalişkan S, Goldin-Meadow S |title=Gesture is at the cutting edge of early language development |journal=Cognition |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=B101–13 |date=July 2005  |pmid=15996556 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2005.01.001|last2=Goldin-Meadow }}</ref> This addresses the idea that gestures quickly change in humans from a sole means of communication (from a very young age) to a supplemental and predictive behavior that we use despite being able to communicate verbally. This too serves as a parallel to the idea that gestures developed first and language subsequently built upon it.

Two possible scenarios have been proposed for the development of language,<ref name=":1">Rizzolatti, G. (2008). Giacomo Rizzolatti on the Evolution of Language. Retrieved from http://gocognitive.net/interviews/evolution-language-gestures{{full citation needed|date=January 2015}}</ref> one of which supports the gestural theory:
# Language developed from the calls of our ancestors.
# Language was derived from gesture.
The first perspective that language evolved from the calls of our ancestors seems logical because both humans and animals make sounds or cries. One evolutionary reason to refute this is that, anatomically, the center that controls calls in monkeys and other animals is located in a completely different part of the brain than in humans. In monkeys, this center is located in the depths of the brain related to emotions. In the human system, it is located in an area unrelated to emotion. Humans can communicate simply to communicate—without emotions. So, anatomically, this scenario does not work.<ref name=":1" /> Therefore, we resort to the idea that language was derived from gesture (we communicated by gesture first and sound was attached later).

The important question for gestural theories is why there was a shift to vocalization. Various explanations have been proposed: 
# Our ancestors started to use more and more tools, meaning that their hands were occupied and could no longer be used for gesturing.<ref name="Corballis 2002">{{Cite book | last1 =  Corballis | first1 = Michael C. | editors = Alison Wray| title = The transition to language | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-925066-0 | oclc = 48532303 | pages = 161–179}}</ref>
# Manual gesturing requires that speakers and listeners be visible to one another. In many situations, they might need to communicate, even without visual contact—for example after nightfall or when foliage obstructs visibility.
# A composite hypothesis holds that early language took the form of part gestural and part vocal [[mimesis]] (imitative 'song-and-dance'), combining modalities because all signals (like those of nonhuman apes and monkeys) still needed to be costly in order to be intrinsically convincing. In that event, each multi-media display would have needed not just to disambiguate an intended meaning but also to inspire confidence in the signal's reliability.

===Tool-use associated sound in the evolution of language===

Proponents of the motor theory of language evolution have primarily focused on the visual domain and communication through observation of movements. The ''Tool-use sound hypothesis'' suggests that the production and perception of sound also contributed substantially, particularly ''incidental sound of locomotion'' (''ISOL'') and ''tool-use sound'' (''TUS'').<ref name="Larsson, M. 2015">{{cite journal | last1 = Larsson | first1 = M | year = 2015 | title = Tool-use-associated sound in the evolution of language | url = | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 993–1005 | doi=10.1007/s10071-015-0885-x}}</ref> Human bipedalism resulted in rhythmic and more predictable ''ISOL''. That may have stimulated the evolution of musical abilities, auditory working memory, and abilities to produce complex vocalizations, and to mimic natural sounds.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Larsson | first1 = M | year = 2014 | title = Self-generated sounds of locomotion and ventilation and the evolution of human rhythmic abilities | url = | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 1–14 | doi=10.1007/s10071-013-0678-z| pmc = 3889703}}</ref> Since the human brain proficiently extracts information about objects and events from the sounds they produce, ''TUS'', and mimicry of ''TUS'', might have achieved an iconic function. The prevalence of sound symbolism in many extant languages supports this idea. Self-produced TUS activates multimodal brain processing ([[motor neuron]]s, hearing, [[proprioception]], touch, vision), and ''TUS'' stimulates primate audiovisual mirror neurons, which is likely to stimulate the development of association chains. Tool use and auditory gestures involve motor-processing of the forelimbs, which is associated with the evolution of vertebrate vocal communication. The production, perception, and mimicry of ''TUS'' may have resulted in a limited number of vocalizations or protowords that were associated with tool use.<ref name="Larsson, M. 2015"/> A new way to communicate about tools, especially when out of sight, would have had selective advantage. A gradual change in acoustic properties and/or meaning could have resulted in arbitrariness and an expanded repertoire of words. Humans have been increasingly exposed to ''TUS'' over millions of years, coinciding with the period during which spoken language evolved.

===Mirror neurons and language origins===

In humans, [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] studies have reported finding areas homologous to the monkey [[mirror neuron]] system in the [[frontal lobe|inferior frontal cortex]], close to [[Broca's area]], one of the language regions of the brain. This has led to suggestions that human language evolved from a gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons. Mirror neurons have been said to have the potential to provide a mechanism for action-understanding, imitation-learning, and the simulation of other people's behavior.<ref>[[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles, John R.]], ''Gesture, Language Origins, and Right Handedness'', Psycholoqy: 11,#24, 2000</ref> This hypothesis is supported by some [[Cytoarchitectonics|cytoarchitectonic]] homologies between monkey premotor area F5 and human Broca's area.<ref name="Petrides 2005">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Petrides | first1 = M. | last2 = Cadoret | first2 = G. | last3 = Mackey | first3 = S. | title = Orofacial somatomotor responses in the macaque monkey homologue of Broca's area | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7046 | pages = 1235–8 |date=Jun 2005 | doi = 10.1038/nature03628 | pmid = 15988526 | bibcode = 2005Natur.435.1235P }}</ref>

===Putting the baby down theory===
According to [[Dean Falk]]'s 'putting the baby down' theory, vocal interactions between early hominid mothers and infants sparked a sequence of events that led, eventually, to our ancestors' earliest words.<ref name="Falk 2004">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Falk | first1 = D. | title = Prelinguistic evolution in early hominins: whence motherese? | journal = Behav Brain Sci | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 491–503; discussion 503–83 |date=Aug 2004 | url = http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~johnson/COGS260/Falk2004.pdf | pmid = 15773427 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x04000111}}</ref> The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their counterparts in other primates, couldn't move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed to be reassured that they were not being abandoned. Mothers responded by developing 'motherese'—an infant-directed communicative system embracing facial expressions, body language, touching, patting, caressing, laughter, tickling and emotionally expressive contact calls. The argument is that language somehow developed out of all this.<ref name="Falk 2004"/>

In ''[[The Mental and Social Life of Babies]]'', psychologist [[Kenneth Kaye]] noted that no usable adult language could have evolved without interactive communication between very young children and adults. "No symbolic system could have survived from one generation to the next if it could not have been easily acquired by young children under their normal conditions of social life."<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaye|first=K.|title=The Mental and Social Life of Babies|year=1982|publisher=Univ.

=== From where to what theory ===
[[File:From where to what.png|thumb|An illustration of the 'from where to what' model of language evolution.]]
The ‘from where to what’ model is a language evolution model that is derived primarily from the organization of [[language processing in the brain]] and two of its structures: the [[auditory dorsal stream]] and the [[auditory ventral stream]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Poliva|first=Oren|date=2017-09-20|title=From where to what: a neuroanatomically based evolutionary model of the emergence of speech in humans|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.6175.3|journal=F1000Research|volume=4|pages=67|doi=10.12688/f1000research.6175.3|issn=2046-1402}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Poliva|first=Oren|date=2016-06-30|title=From Mimicry to Language: A Neuroanatomically Based Evolutionary Model of the Emergence of Vocal Language|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2016.00307|journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience|volume=10|doi=10.3389/fnins.2016.00307|issn=1662-453X}}</ref> It hypotheses 7 stages of language evolution (see illustration).  Speech originated for the purpose of exchanging contact calls between mothers and their offspring to find one another in the event they became separated (illustration part 1). The contact calls could be modified with intonations in order to express either a higher or lower level of distress (illustration part 2). The use of two types of contact calls enabled the first question-answer conversation. In this scenario, the child would emit a low-level distress call to express a desire to interact with an object, and the mother would respond with either another low-level distress call (to express approval of the interaction) or a high-level distress call (to express disapproval) (illustration part 3). Over time, the improved use of intonations and vocal control led to the invention of unique calls (phonemes) associated with distinct objects (illustration part 4).  At first, children learned the calls (phonemes) from their parents by imitating their lip-movements (illustration part 5).  Eventually, infants were able to encode into long-term memory all the calls (phonemes). Consequentially, mimicry via lip-reading was limited to infancy and older children learned new calls through mimicry without lip-reading (illustration part 6).  Once individuals became capable of producing a sequence of calls, this allowed multi-syllabic words, which increased the size of their vocabulary (illustration part 7).  The use of words, composed of sequences of syllables, provided the infra structure for communicating with sequences of words (i.e., sentences).

The theory's name is derived from the two auditory streams, which are both found in the brains of humans and other primates.  The auditory ventral stream is responsible for sound recognition, and so it is referred to as the auditory ''what'' stream.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=S.

Supporting this model is also its ability to explain unique human phenomena, such as the use of intonations when converting words into commands and questions, the tendency of infants to mimic vocalizations during the first year of life (and its disappearance later on) and the protruding and visible human lips, which are not found in other apes. This theory could be considered an elaboration of the 'putting the baby down' theory of language evolution.

===Grammaticalisation theory===
'[[Grammaticalization|Grammaticalisation]]' is a continuous historical process in which free-standing words develop into grammatical appendages, while these in turn become ever more specialized and grammatical. An initially 'incorrect' usage, in becoming accepted, leads to unforeseen consequences, triggering knock-on effects and extended sequences of change. Paradoxically, grammar evolves because, in the final analysis, humans care less about grammatical niceties than about making themselves understood.<ref>Sperber, D. and D. Wilson 1986. ''Relevance. Communication and cognition.'' Oxford: Blackwell.</ref> If this is how grammar evolves today, according to this school of thought, we can legitimately infer similar principles at work among our distant ancestors, when grammar itself was first being established.<ref name="Deutscher 2005">{{Cite book  | last1 = Deutscher | first1 = Guy | title = The unfolding of language : an evolutionary tour of mankind's greatest invention | year = 2005 | publisher = Metropolitan Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-8050-7907-4 | oclc = 57311730 }}</ref><ref>Hopper, P.

In order to reconstruct the evolutionary transition from early language to languages with complex grammars, we need to know which hypothetical sequences are plausible and which are not. In order to convey abstract ideas, the first recourse of speakers is to fall back on immediately recognizable concrete imagery, very often deploying [[metaphor]]s rooted in shared bodily experience.<ref name="Lakoff, G 1980">Lakoff, G. and M. Johnson 1980. ''Metaphors We Live By.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref> A familiar example is the use of concrete terms such as 'belly' or 'back' to convey abstract meanings such as 'inside' or 'behind'. Equally metaphorical is the strategy of representing temporal patterns on the model of spatial ones. For example, English speakers might say 'It is going to rain,' modeled on 'I am going to London.' This can be abbreviated colloquially to 'It's gonna rain.' Even when in a hurry, we don't say 'I'm gonna London'—the contraction is restricted to the job of specifying tense. From such examples we can see why grammaticalization is consistently unidirectional—from concrete to abstract meaning, not the other way around.<ref name="Deutscher 2005"/>

Grammaticalization theorists picture early language as simple, perhaps consisting only of nouns.<ref name="Heine 2007"/><sup>p.&nbsp;111</sup> Even under that extreme theoretical assumption, however, it is difficult to imagine what would realistically have prevented people from using, say, 'spear' as if it were a verb ('Spear that pig!'). People might have used their nouns as verbs or their verbs as nouns as occasion demanded. In short, while a noun-only language might seem theoretically possible, grammaticalization theory indicates that it cannot have remained fixed in that state for any length of time.<ref name="Deutscher 2005"/><ref name="Heine Kuteva 2012">{{Cite book | last1 =  Heine

Creativity drives grammatical change.<ref name="Heine Kuteva 2012"/> This presupposes a certain attitude on the part of listeners. Instead of punishing deviations from accepted usage, listeners must prioritize imaginative mind-reading. Imaginative creativity—emitting a leopard alarm when no leopard was present, for example—is not the kind of behavior which, say, [[vervet monkey]]s would appreciate or reward.<ref name="Cheney Seyfarth 2005">{{cite journal|last1=Cheney|first1=Dorothy L.|last2=Seyfarth|first2=Robert M.|title=Constraints and preadaptations in the earliest stages of language evolution|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2–4| pages = 135–59|year=2005|url=http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~seyfarth/Publications/LinguisticReview.pdf|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.135}}</ref> Creativity and reliability are incompatible demands; for 'Machiavellian' primates as for animals generally, the overriding pressure is to demonstrate reliability.<ref name="Maynard Smith 2003">{{Cite book  | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = John | last2 = Harper | first2 = David | title = Animal signals | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-852684-1 | oclc = 54460090 }}</ref> If humans escape these constraints, it is because in our case, listeners are primarily interested in mental states.

To focus on mental states is to accept fictions—inhabitants of the imagination—as potentially informative and interesting. Take the use of metaphor. A metaphor is, literally, a false statement.<ref>Davidson, R. D. 1979. What metaphors mean. In S. Sacks (ed.), ''On Metaphor.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 29–45.</ref> Think of Romeo's declaration, 'Juliet is the sun!' Juliet is a woman, not a ball of plasma in the sky, but human listeners are not (or not usually) pedants insistent on point-by-point factual accuracy. They want to know what the speaker has in mind. Grammaticalization is essentially based on metaphor. To outlaw its use would be to stop grammar from evolving and, by the same token, to exclude all possibility of expressing abstract thought.<ref name="Lakoff, G 1980"/><ref>Lakoff, G. and R. Núñez 2000. ''Where mathematics comes from.'' New York: Basic Books.</ref>

A criticism of all this is that while grammaticalization theory might explain language change today, it does not satisfactorily address the really difficult challenge—explaining the initial transition from primate-style communication to language as we know it. Rather, the theory assumes that language already exists. As Bernd Heine and Tania Kuteva acknowledge: "Grammaticalization requires a linguistic system that is used regularly and frequently within a community of speakers and is passed on from one group of speakers to another".<ref name="Heine 2007"/> Outside modern humans, such conditions do not prevail.

=== Evolution-Progression Model ===

Human language is used for self-expression; however, expression displays different stages. The consciousness of self and feelings represents the stage immediately prior to the external, phonetic expression of feelings in the form of sound, i.e., language. Intelligent animals such as dolphins, Eurasian magpies, and chimpanzees live in communities, wherein they assign themselves roles for group survival and show emotions such as sympathy.<ref name="Gallup">{{cite journal| author = Gallup, GG Jr.| title = Chimpanzees: Self recognition| journal = Science

===Self-domesticated ape theory===
According to a study investigating the song differences between [[white-rumped munia]]s and its domesticated counterpart ([[society finch|Bengalese finch]]), the wild munias use a highly stereotyped song sequence, whereas the domesticated ones sing a highly unconstrained song. In wild finches, song syntax is subject to female preference—[[sexual selection]]—and remains relatively fixed. However, in the Bengalese finch, natural selection is replaced by breeding, in this case for colorful plumage, and thus, decoupled from selective pressures, stereotyped song syntax is allowed to drift. It is replaced, supposedly within 1000 generations, by a variable and learned sequence. Wild finches, moreover, are thought incapable of learning song sequences from other finches.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Soma, M., Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, M., & Okanoya, K.|year=2009|title=Early ontogenetic effects on song quality in the Bengalese finch (''Lonchura striata var. domestica''): laying order, sibling competition and song sintax |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume= 63|pages=363–370|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1085n85073j6174/fulltext.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0670-9|issue=3|last2=Hiraiwa-Hasegawa|last3=Okanoya}}</ref> In the field of [[bird vocalization]], brains capable of producing only an innate song have very simple neural pathways: the primary forebrain motor center, called the robust nucleus of [[arcopallium]], connects to midbrain vocal outputs, which in turn project to brainstem motor nuclei. By contrast, in brains capable of learning songs, the arcopallium receives input from numerous additional forebrain regions, including those involved in learning and social experience. Control over song generation has become less constrained, more distributed, and more flexible.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Soma, M., Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, M., & Okanoya, K.|year=2009|title=Early ontogenetic effects on song quality in the Bengalese finch (''Lonchura striata var. domestica''): laying order, sibling competition and song syntax |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume= 63|pages=363–370|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1085n85073j6174/fulltext.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0670-9|issue=3|last2=Hiraiwa-Hasegawa|last3=Okanoya}}</ref>

One way to think about human evolution is that we are self-domesticated apes. Just as domestication relaxed selection for stereotypic songs in the finches—mate choice was supplanted by choices made by the aesthetic sensibilities of bird breeders and their customers—so might our cultural domestication have relaxed selection on many of our primate behavioral traits, allowing old pathways to degenerate and reconfigure. Given the highly indeterminate way that mammalian brains develop—they basically construct themselves "bottom up", with one set of neuronal interactions setting the stage for the next round of interactions—degraded pathways would tend to seek out and find new opportunities for synaptic hookups. Such inherited de-differentiations of brain pathways might have contributed to the functional complexity that characterizes human language. And, as exemplified by the finches, such de-differentiations can occur in very rapid time-frames.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Graham Ritchie|author2=Simon Kirby|lastauthoramp=yes|year=2005|title=Selection, domestication, and the emergence of learned communication systems|journal=Second International Symposium on the Emergence and Evolution of Linguistic Communication|volume=|pages=|url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0237680/pubs/ritchie_05_selection.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121153322/http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0237680/pubs/ritchie_05_selection.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-21|df=}}</ref>

== Speech and language for communication ==
{{See also|Animal communication|Animal language|Origin of speech}}
A distinction can be drawn between [[speech]] and [[language]]. Language is not necessarily spoken: it might alternatively be written or signed. Speech is among a number of different methods of encoding and transmitting linguistic information, albeit arguably the most natural one.<ref>MacNeilage, P. 1998. Evolution of the mechanism of language output: comparative neurobiology of vocal and manual communication. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C. Knight (eds), Approaches to the Evolution of Language. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 222 41.</ref>

Some scholars view language as an initially cognitive development, its 'externalisation' to serve communicative purposes occurring later in human evolution. According to one such school of thought, the key feature distinguishing human language is [[recursion]],<ref name="Hauser 2002">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hauser | first1 = MD. | last2 = Chomsky | first2 = N. | last3 = Fitch | first3 = WT. | title = The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5598 | pages = 1569–79 | date = Nov 2002 | doi = 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 | pmid = 12446899 | url = http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131228122250/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | archivedate = 2013-12-28 | df =  }}</ref> (in this context, the iterative embedding of phrases within phrases). Other scholars—notably [[Daniel Everett]]—deny that recursion is universal, citing certain languages (e.g. [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]]) which allegedly lack this feature.<ref name="Everett 2005">{{cite journal|last1=Everett|first1=Daniel L.|title=Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Piraha Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language|journal=Current Anthropology| volume=46| issue=4|year=2005| pages=621–646| doi=10.1086/431525|url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf}}</ref>

The ability to ask questions is considered by some to distinguish language from non-human systems of communication.<ref>{{cite book | last = Zhordania | first = I. M. | title = Who asked the first question : the origins of human choral singing, intelligence, language and speech | publisher = Logos Tbilisi Ivane Javakhishvili State University | location = Tbilisi, Georgia | year = 2006 | isbn = 9789994031818 | oclc= 224993377}}</ref> Some captive primates (notably [[bonobos]] and [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]]), having learned to use rudimentary signing to communicate with their human trainers, proved able to respond correctly to complex questions and requests. Yet they failed to ask even the simplest questions themselves. {{Citation needed|reason=The chimp Washoe, pointing first doll, and then the mouth was able to ask the simple question: Time to eat?|date=January 2014}} Conversely, human children are able to ask their first questions (using only question [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]) at the babbling period of their development, long before they start using syntactic structures. Although babies from different cultures acquire native languages from their social environment, all languages of the world without exception—tonal, non-tonal, intonational and accented—use similar rising "question intonation" for [[yes–no question]]s.<ref>Bolinger, Dwight L. (Editor) 1972. ''Intonation''. Selected Readings.

In general, according to some authors, sentence intonation/pitch is pivotal in spoken grammar and is the basic information used by children to learn the grammar of whatever language.<ref name="auto" />

==Cognitive development and language==
One of the intriguing abilities that language users have is that of high-level [[reference]] (or [[deixis]]), the ability to refer to things or states of being that are not in the immediate realm of the speaker. This ability is often related to theory of mind, or an awareness of the other as a being like the self with individual wants and intentions. According to Chomsky, Hauser and Fitch (2002), there are six main aspects of this high-level reference system:

* [[Theory of mind]]
* Capacity to acquire non-linguistic conceptual representations, such as the object/kind distinction
* Referential vocal signals
* Imitation as a rational, intentional system
* Voluntary control over signal production as evidence of intentional communication
* [[Numerical cognition|Number representation]]<ref name="Hauser 2002"/>

===Theory of mind===
[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] (1999) argues that theory of mind must have preceded language use, based on evidence{{clarify|date=October 2017}} of use of the following characteristics as much as 40,000 years ago: intentional communication, repairing failed communication, teaching, intentional persuasion, intentional deception, building shared plans and goals, intentional sharing of focus or topic, and pretending. Moreover, Baron-Cohen argues that many primates show some, but not all, of these abilities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Call and Tomasello's research on [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]] supports this, in that individual chimps seem to understand that other chimps have awareness, knowledge, and intention, but do not seem to understand false beliefs. Many primates show some tendencies toward a theory of mind, but not a full one as humans have.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
Ultimately, there is some consensus within the field that a theory of mind is necessary for language use. Thus, the development of a full theory of mind in humans was a necessary precursor to full language use.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Number representation===
In one particular study, rats and pigeons were required to press a button a certain number of times to get food. The animals showed very accurate distinction for numbers less than four, but as the numbers increased, the error rate increased.<ref name="Hauser 2002"/> Matsuzawa (1985) attempted to teach chimpanzees Arabic numerals. The difference between primates and humans in this regard was very large, as it took the chimps thousands of trials to learn 1–9 with each number requiring a similar amount of training time; yet, after learning the meaning of 1, 2 and 3 (and sometimes 4), children easily comprehend the value of greater integers by using a successor function (i.e. 2 is 1 greater than 1, 3 is 1 greater than 2, 4 is 1 greater than 3; once 4 is reached it seems most children have an [[A-Ha! moment|"a-ha!" moment]] and understand that the value of any integer ''n'' is 1 greater than the previous integer). Put simply, other primates learn the meaning of numbers one by one, similar to their approach to other referential symbols, while children first learn an arbitrary list of symbols (1, 2, 3, 4...) and then later learn their precise meanings.<ref name="Carey 2001">{{cite journal|last1=Carey|first1=Susan|title=Cognitive Foundations of Arithmetic: Evolution and Ontogenisis|journal=Mind and Language| volume=16|issue=1|year=2001| pages=37–55 |doi=10.1111/1468-0017.00155|url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/pdfs/carey2001c.pdf}}</ref> These results can be seen as evidence for the application of the "open-ended generative property" of language in human numeral cognition.<ref name="Hauser 2002"/>

==Linguistic structures==

===Lexical-phonological principle===
Hockett (1966) details a list of features regarded as essential to describing human language.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hockett|first1=Charles F.|title=The Origin of Speech|journal=Scientific American| volume=203| issue=3|year=1960|pages=88–96|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0960-88|url=http://www.gifted.ucalgary.ca/dflynn/files/dflynn/Hockett60.pdf|bibcode=1960SciAm.203c..88H}}</ref> In the domain of the lexical-phonological principle, two features of this list are most important:

* Productivity: users can create and understand completely novel messages.
** New messages are freely coined by blending, analogizing from, or transforming old ones.
** Either new or old elements are freely assigned new semantic loads by circumstances and context. This says that in every language, new idioms constantly come into existence.
*Duality (of Patterning): a large number of meaningful elements are made up of a conveniently small number of independently meaningless yet message-differentiating elements.

The sound system of a language is composed of a finite set of simple phonological items. Under the specific [[phonotactic]] rules of a given language, these items can be recombined and concatenated, giving rise to [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and the open-ended lexicon. A key feature of language is that a simple, finite set of phonological items gives rise to an infinite lexical system wherein rules determine the form of each item, and meaning is inextricably linked with form. Phonological syntax, then, is a simple combination of pre-existing phonological units. Related to this is another essential feature of human language: lexical syntax, wherein pre-existing units are combined, giving rise to semantically novel or distinct lexical items.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Certain elements of the lexical-phonological principle are known to exist outside of humans. While all (or nearly all) have been documented in some form in the natural world, very few coexist within the same species. Bird-song, singing nonhuman apes, and the songs of whales all display phonological syntax, combining units of sound into larger structures apparently devoid of enhanced or novel meaning. Certain other primate species do have simple phonological systems with units referring to entities in the world. However, in contrast to human systems, the units in these primates' systems normally occur in isolation, betraying a lack of lexical syntax. There is new evidence to suggest that Campbell's monkeys also display lexical syntax, combining two calls (a predator alarm call with a "boom", the combination of which denotes a lessened threat of danger), however it is still unclear whether this is a lexical or a morphological phenomenon.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Pidgins and creoles===
{{Main|Creole language|pidgin}}
Pidgins are significantly simplified languages with only rudimentary grammar and a restricted vocabulary. In their early stage, pidgins mainly consist of nouns, verbs, and adjectives with few or no articles, prepositions, conjunctions or auxiliary verbs. Often the grammar has no fixed [[word order]] and the words have no [[inflection]].<ref name="Diamond 1992">{{Cite book  | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Jared M. | title = The third chimpanzee : the evolution and future of the human animal |chapter = Bridges to human language | year = 1992 | publisher = HarperCollins | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-06-018307-3 | oclc = 24246928| pages = 141–167 }}</ref>

If contact is maintained between the groups speaking the pidgin for long periods of time, the pidgins may become more complex over many generations. If the children of one generation adopt the pidgin as their native language it develops into a [[creole language]], which becomes fixed and acquires a more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding. The syntax and morphology of such languages may often have local innovations not obviously derived from any of the parent languages.

Studies of creole languages around the world have suggested that they display remarkable similarities in grammar{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} and are developed uniformly from pidgins in a single generation. These similarities are apparent even when creoles do not share any common language origins. In addition, creoles share similarities despite being developed in isolation from each other. [[Language bioprogram theory|Syntactic similarities]] include [[subject–verb–object]] word order. Even when creoles are derived from languages with a different word order they often develop the SVO word order. Creoles tend to have similar usage patterns for definite and indefinite articles, and similar movement rules for phrase structures even when the parent languages do not.<ref name="Diamond 1992"/>

===Primate communication===
Field primatologists can give us useful insights into [[great ape]] communication in the wild.<ref name="Arcadi 2000"/> An important finding is that nonhuman primates, including the other great apes, produce calls that are graded, as opposed to categorically differentiated, with listeners striving to evaluate subtle gradations in signalers' emotional and bodily states. Nonhuman apes seemingly find it extremely difficult to produce vocalizations in the absence of the corresponding emotional states.<ref name="Goodall 1986"/> In captivity, nonhuman apes have been taught rudimentary forms of sign language or have been persuaded to use [[lexigrams]]—symbols that do not graphically resemble the corresponding words—on computer keyboards. Some nonhuman apes, such as [[Kanzi]], have been able to learn and use hundreds of lexigrams.<ref name="Savage-Rumbaugh 1994">{{Cite book  | last1 = Savage-Rumbaugh | first1 = E.

The [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s in the primate brain are responsible for controlling the muscles of the face, tongue, mouth, and larynx, as well as recognizing sounds. Primates are known to make "vocal calls", and these calls are generated by circuits in the [[brainstem]] and [[limbic system]].<ref name=Freeman>Freeman, Scott; Jon C. Herron., ''Evolutionary Analysis'' (4th ed.), Pearson Education, Inc. (2007), {{ISBN|0-13-227584-8}} pages 789–90</ref>

In the wild, the communication of [[vervet monkey]]s has been the most extensively studied.<ref name="Diamond 1992"/> They are known to make up to ten different vocalizations. Many of these are used to warn other members of the group about approaching predators. They include a "leopard call", a "snake call", and an "eagle call".<ref name="Seyfarth Cheney 1980">{{cite journal|last1=Seyfarth|first1=Robert M.|last2=Cheney|first2=Dorothy L.| last3=Marler| first3=Peter| title=Vervet monkey alarm calls: Semantic communication in a free-ranging primate|journal=Animal Behaviour| volume=28| issue=4| year=1980| pages=1070–1094 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(80)80097-2}}</ref> Each call triggers a different defensive strategy in the monkeys who hear the call and scientists were able to elicit predictable responses from the monkeys using loudspeakers and prerecorded sounds.

Similarly, researchers have demonstrated that chimpanzees (in captivity) use different "words" in reference to different foods. They recorded vocalizations that chimps made in reference, for example, to grapes, and then other chimps pointed at pictures of grapes when they heard the recorded sound.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=osu1173219994 | title=The referentiality of chimpanzee vocal signaling: behavioral and acoustic analysis of food barks |author=Gibbons, Christopher M.| year=2007 |publisher=[[Ohio State University]]| postscript=.}}</ref><ref name="Slocombe Zuberbühler 2005">{{cite journal|last1=Slocombe|first1=Katie E.|last2=Zuberbühler|first2=Klaus|title=Functionally Referential Communication in a Chimpanzee|journal=Current Biology|volume=15| issue=19|year=2005| pages=1779–1784|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.08.068|pmid=16213827}}</ref>

===''Ardipithecus ramidus''===

A study published in ''Homo: Journal of Comparative Human Biology'' in 2017 claims that ''A. ramidus'',  a hominin dated at approximately 4.5Ma, shows the first evidence of an anatomical shift in the hominin lineage suggestive of increased vocal capability.<ref name="auto1">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej |volume=68 |pages=101–121}}</ref> This study compared the skull of ''A. ramidus'' with twenty nine chimpanzee skulls of different ages and found that in numerous features ''A. ramidus'' clustered with the infant and juvenile measures as opposed to the adult measures. Significantly, such affinity with the shape dimensions of infant and juvenile chimpanzee skull architecture was argued may have resulted in greater vocal capability. This assertion was based on the notion that the chimpanzee vocal tract ratios that prevent speech are a result of growth factors associated with puberty—growth factors absent in ''A. ramidus'' ontogeny.  ''A. ramidus'' was also found to have a degree of cervical lordosis more conducive to vocal modulation when compared with chimpanzees as well as cranial base architecture suggestive of increased vocal capability.

What was significant in this study was the observation that the changes in skull architecture that correlate with reduced aggression are the same changes necessary for the evolution of early hominin vocal ability. In integrating data on anatomical correlates of primate mating and social systems with studies of skull and vocal tract architecture that facilitate speech production, the authors argue that [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] to date have failed to grasp the important relationship between early hominin social evolution and language capacity.

While the skull of ''A. ramidus'', according to the authors, lacks the anatomical impediments to speech evident in chimpanzees, it is unclear what the vocal capabilities of this early hominin were. While they suggest ''A. ramidus''—based on similar vocal tract ratios—may have had vocal capabilities equivalent to a modern human infant or very young child, they concede this is obviously a debatable and speculative hypothesis. However, they do claim that changes in skull architecture through processes of social selection were a necessary prerequisite for language evolution. As they write:

{{quote|We propose that as a result of paedomorphic morphogenesis of the cranial base and craniofacial morphology ''Ar. ramidus'' would have not been limited in terms of the mechanical components of speech production as chimpanzees and bonobos are. It is possible that ''Ar. ramidus'' had vocal capability approximating that of chimpanzees and bonobos, with its idiosyncratic skull morphology not resulting in any significant advances in speech capability. In this sense the anatomical features analysed in this essay would have been exapted in later more voluble species of hominin. However, given the selective advantages of pro-social vocal synchrony, we suggest the species would have developed significantly more complex vocal abilities than chimpanzees and bonobos.<ref name="auto1"/>}}

===Early ''Homo''===
Regarding articulation, there is considerable speculation about the language capabilities of early ''[[Homo]]'' (2.5 to 0.8 million years ago). Anatomically, some scholars believe features of [[bipedalism]], which developed in [[australopithecine]]s around 3.5 million years ago, would have brought changes to the skull, allowing for a more L-shaped vocal tract.

However, although Neanderthals may have been anatomically able to speak, [[Richard G. Klein]] in 2004 doubted that they possessed a fully modern language. He largely bases his doubts on the fossil record of archaic humans and their stone tool kit. For 2 million years following the emergence of ''Homo habilis,'' the stone tool technology of hominins changed very little. Klein, who has worked extensively on ancient stone tools, describes the crude stone tool kit of archaic humans as impossible to break down into categories based on their function, and reports that Neanderthals seem to have had little concern for the final aesthetic form of their tools. Klein argues that the Neanderthal brain may have not reached the level of complexity required for modern speech, even if the physical apparatus for speech production was well-developed.<ref name="kleinbio">{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0402190101 |pmid=15079069 |pmc=395972 |title=Biography of Richard G.

===The descended larynx===
[[File:Illu larynx.jpg]]

The '''[[larynx]]''' or '''voice box''' is an organ in the neck housing the [[vocal folds]], which are responsible for [[phonation]]. In humans, the larynx is ''descended''. Our species is not unique in this respect: goats, dogs, pigs and tamarins lower the larynx temporarily, to emit loud calls.<ref name="Fitch.

Despite all this, scholars remain divided as to how "special" the human vocal tract really is. It has been shown that the larynx does descend to some extent during development in chimpanzees, followed by hyoidal descent.<ref name="Nishimura 2006">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the hyoid in chimpanzees: evolution of face flattening and speech. | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–54 |date=Sep 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.03.005 | pmid = 16730049 }}</ref> As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the epiglottis and velum is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing. Since this entails substantial costs—increasing the risk of choking while swallowing food—we are forced to ask what benefits might have outweighed those costs. The obvious benefit—so it is claimed—must have been speech. But this idea has been vigorously contested. One objection is that humans are in fact ''not'' seriously at risk of choking on food: medical statistics indicate that accidents of this kind are extremely rare.<ref>M. Clegg 2001. The Comparative Anatomy and Evolution of the Human Vocal Tract Unpublished thesis, University of London.</ref> Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of ''Homo sapiens.''<ref name="Perreault 2012"/> A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was ''initially'' driven by selection pressures for speech, thus not excluding that it was selected for e.g. improved singing ability.

==== The size exaggeration hypothesis ====
To lower the larynx is to increase the length of the vocal tract, in turn lowering [[formant]] frequencies so that the voice sounds "deeper"—giving an impression of greater size. John Ohala argues that the function of the lowered larynx in humans, especially males, is probably to enhance threat displays rather than speech itself.<ref>John J. Ohala, 2000. [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~ohala/papers/lowered_larynx.pdf The irrelevance of the lowered larynx in modern Man for the development of speech.] Paris, ENST: ''The Evolution of Language,'' pp. 171–172.</ref> Ohala points out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, we would expect adult human males to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low. In fact, females invariably outperform males in verbal tests,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} falsifying this whole line of reasoning. W. Tecumseh Fitch likewise argues that this was the original selective advantage of laryngeal lowering in our species. Although (according to Fitch) the initial lowering of the larynx in humans had nothing to do with speech, the increased range of possible formant patterns was subsequently co-opted for speech. Size exaggeration remains the sole function of the extreme laryngeal descent observed in male deer. Consistent with the size exaggeration hypothesis, a second descent of the larynx occurs at puberty in humans, although only in males. In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalising to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability.<ref>Fitch, W. T. (2002). Comparative vocal production and the evolution of speech: Reinterpreting the descent of the larynx. In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 21–45.</ref>

===Phonemic diversity===
In 2011, Quentin Atkinson published a survey of [[phoneme]]s from 500 different languages as well as [[language families]] and compared their phonemic diversity by region, number of speakers and distance from Africa.  The survey revealed that African languages had the largest number of phonemes, and [[Oceanic languages|Oceania]] and South America had the smallest number.  After allowing for the number of speakers, the phonemic diversity was compared to over 2000 possible origin locations.  Atkinson's "best fit" model is that language originated in central and southern Africa between 80,000 and 160,000 years ago.  This predates the hypothesized [[Coastal migration|southern coastal peopling]] of Arabia, India, southeast Asia, and Australia.  It would also mean that the origin of language occurred at the same time as the emergence of symbolic culture.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Atkinson |first=Quentin |title=Phonemic Diversity Supports a Serial Founder Effect Model of Language Expansion from Africa |url=http://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~pmcc/prelims/2011/Atkinson-346-9.pdf |work=Science Magazine |volume=332 |pages=346–349 |date=2011 |access-date=9 July 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.1199295 |pmid=21493858|bibcode=2011Sci...332..346A }}</ref>

==History==

===In religion and mythology===
{{Main|Mythical origins of language}}
{{See also|Divine language|Adamic language}}
The search for the origin of language has a long history rooted in [[mythology]]. Most mythologies do not credit humans with the invention of language but speak of a [[divine language]] predating human language. Mystical languages used to communicate with animals or spirits, such as the [[language of the birds]], are also common, and were of particular interest during the [[Renaissance]].

[[Vāc]] is the Hindu goddess of speech, or "speech personified". As [[Brahman]]'s "sacred utterance", she has a cosmological role as the "Mother of the [[Veda]]s". The [[Aztecs]]' story maintains that only a man, [[Coxcox]], and a woman, [[Xochiquetzal]], survived a flood, having floated on a piece of bark. They found themselves on land and begat many children who were at first born unable to speak, but subsequently, upon the arrival of a [[dove]], were endowed with language, although each one was given a different speech such that they could not understand one another.<ref>Turner, P. and Russell-Coulter, C. (2001) ''Dictionary of Ancient Deities'' (Oxford: OUP)</ref>

In the Old Testament, the Book of Genesis (11) says that God prevented the [[Tower of Babel]] from being completed through a miracle that made its construction workers start speaking different languages.  After this, they migrated to other regions, grouped together according to which of the newly created languages they spoke, explaining the origins of languages and nations outside of the fertile crescent.<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert T. |last=Pennock |title=Tower of Babel: The Evidence against the New Creationism |publisher=Bradford Books |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aC1OccYnX0sC&dq=Tower+of+Babel:+The+Evidence+Against+the+New+Creationism|isbn=9780262661652 }}</ref>

===Historical experiments===
{{main|Language deprivation experiments}}
History contains a number of anecdotes about people who attempted to discover the origin of language by experiment. The first such tale was told by [[Herodotus]] (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 2.2). He relates that Pharaoh Psammetichus (probably [[Psammetichus I]], 7th century BC) had two children raised by a shepherd, with the instructions that no one should speak to them, but that the shepherd should feed and care for them while listening to determine their first words. When one of the children cried "bekos" with outstretched arms the shepherd concluded that the word was [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]], because that was the sound of the Phrygian word for "bread". From this, Psammetichus concluded that the first language was Phrygian. King [[James V of Scotland]] is said to have tried a similar experiment; his children were supposed to have spoken [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>{{Cite book

Both the medieval monarch [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and [[Akbar]] are said to have tried similar experiments; the children involved in these experiments did not speak. The current situation of [[deaf people]] also points into this direction.

===History of research===
{{Main|Evolutionary linguistics}}
Modern linguistics does not begin until the late 18th century, and the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[animism#Philosophy|animist]] theses of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Johann Christoph Adelung]] remained influential well into the 19th century. The question of language origin seemed inaccessible to methodical approaches, and in 1866 the [[Linguistic Society of Paris]] famously banned all discussion of the origin of language, deeming it to be an unanswerable problem. An increasingly systematic approach to [[historical linguistics]] developed in the course of the 19th century, reaching its culmination in the [[Neogrammarian]] school of [[Karl Brugmann]] and others.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

However, scholarly interest in the question of the origin of language has only gradually been rekindled from the 1950s on (and then controversially) with ideas such as [[universal grammar]], [[mass comparison]] and [[glottochronology]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The "origin of language" as a subject in its own right emerged from studies in [[neurolinguistics]], [[psycholinguistics]] and [[human evolution]]. The ''[[Linguistic Bibliography]]'' introduced "Origin of language" as a separate heading in 1988, as a sub-topic of psycholinguistics. Dedicated research institutes of [[evolutionary linguistics]] are a recent phenomenon, emerging only in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
