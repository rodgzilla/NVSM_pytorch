The use of terms and images referring to Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans/First Nations as the name or mascot for a sports team is a topic of public controversy in the United States and Canada. Since the 1960s, as part of the Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements, there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the Cleveland Indians (in particular their "Chief Wahoo" logo, now officially retired); and the Washington Redskins (the term "Redskin (slang)|redskins" being defined in most American English dictionaries as "derogatory slang"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, have been made since the 1970s.

The issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a fuller understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.<ref name="King.2010">cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

Defenders of the current usage often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages.<ref name="Davis.2010">cite journal| issn = 1068-3844| volume = 9| issue = 4| pages = 11–14| last = Davis| first = Laurel R.| title = The problems with Native American mascots| journal = Multicultural Education| accessdate = October 10, 2017|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ649928</ref> In general, the social sciences recognize that all stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship.

History
European Americans have had a history of "playing Indian" that dates back to the Colonial history of the United States|colonial period. In the 19th century, fraternal organizations such as the Tammanies|Tammany Societies and the Improved Order of Red Men adopted the words and material culture of Native Americans in part to establish an aboriginal identity, while ignoring the dispossession and conquest of indigenous peoples.<ref>cite book| last=Deloria| first=Philip J.| year=1998| title=Playing Indian| location=New Haven| publisher=Yale University Press</ref><ref>cite web| url=http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300080674/playing-indian| title=Playing Indian| publisher=Yale University Press| accessdate=January 6, 2016| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630090119/http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300080674/playing-indian| archivedate=June 30, 2016| df=</ref> This practice spread to youth groups such as the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) (in particular, the Order of the Arrow) and many summer camps. University students in the late 19th and early 20th centuries adopted Indian names and symbols for their sports teams, not from authentic sources but rather as Native American life was imagined by European Americans.<ref name="Spindel">cite book|last=Spindel|first=Carol|year=2002|title=Dancing at Halftime: Sports and the Controversy Over American Indian Mascots|location=New York|publisher=New York University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Dancing_at_Halftime.html?id=4p62ket04PgC</ref>

Professional team nicknames had similar origins. In professional baseball the team that is now the Atlanta Braves was founded as the Boston Red Stockings in 1871; becoming the History of the Boston Braves|Boston Braves in 1912. Their owner at that time, James E. Gaffney|James Gaffney, was a member of New York City's political machine, Tammany Hall, one of the societies formed to honor Tamanend, a chief of the Lenape|Delaware. The team that moved to become the Washington Redskins in 1937 was originally also known as the Boston Braves since the American football|football and baseball teams played at Braves Field. After moving to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a "red" identifier while retaining the Braves "Indian Head" logo. While defenders of the Redskins often cite coach William Henry Dietz, who claimed Native American heritage, to justify the name; the use of Native American names and imagery by this National Football League|NFL team began in 1932 before hiring Dietz in 1933.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/wasbos/bosskins.html|title=The Boston Redskins|accessdate=2013-04-24</ref>

The Cleveland Indians' name originated from a request by club owner Charles Somers to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace the "Naps" following the departure of their star player Nap Lajoie after the 1914 season.<ref>cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Baseball writers select "Indians" as the best name to apply to the former Naps |url= |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=January 17, 1915 |access-date= |quote=With the going of Nap Lajoie to the Athletics, a new name had to be selected for the Cleveland American league club.

The stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context of history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures, such as the Native American boarding schools|boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from their families in order to educate them as European Americans.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/policy/mascots-justif.pdf|title=APA Resolution Justifications|year=2005|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=2013-01-21</ref> As stated in an editorial by Carter Meland (Anishinaabe heritage) and David E.

Native mascots are also part of the larger issues of cultural appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups.<ref>cite journal| last=Riley| first=Angela| title=Straight Stealing: Towards an Indigenous System of Cultural Property Protection| journal=Washington Law Review| volume=80| issue=69| date=2005| ssrn=703283</ref> Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic Social exclusion|marginalization.

Not all Native Americans are united in total opposition to mascots. Steven Denson, director of diversity for Southern Methodist University and member of the Chickasaw nation, while not issuing a blanket endorsement, has nevertheless stated that there are acceptable ways to use Native American mascots if it is done in a respectful and tasteful manner. He states: "I believe it is acceptable if used in a way that fosters understanding and increased positive awareness of the Native-American culture. And it must also be done with the support of the Native-American community. There is a way to achieve a partnership that works together to achieve mutually beneficial goals."<ref name="SMU">cite web| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/153383/nativeamerican_nicknamesmascots/index.html| title=Native-American Nicknames/Mascots|publisher=Red Orbit| date=June 2, 2005</ref> The NCAI recognized the right of individual tribes to established relationships with teams which allowed them to retain their names.<ref name="NCAI">cite web|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamation-mascots|title=Anti-Defamation and Mascots|publisher=National Congress of American Indians|accessdate=12 January 2013</ref>

The harm done by the use of Native American mascots, particularly in an academic context, was stated by the Society of Indian Psychologists in 1999:
<blockquote>''Stereotypical and historically inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views of indigenous peoples and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they contribute to the development of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.''<ref>cite web|url=http://aiansip.org/uploads/SIP_Indian_Mascot_Position_Statement.pdf| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031052230/http://aiansip.org/uploads/SIP_Indian_Mascot_Position_Statement.pdf| archive-date=October 31, 2015|title=Society of Indian Psychologists|date=January 27, 1999|accessdate=2013-08-19</ref></blockquote>

In 2005, the American Psychological Association (APA) issued a resolution "Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment, the negative impact on the self-esteem of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil rights.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) passed a resolution calling for the end of the use of Native American names, images, and mascots in 1999.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.aistm.org/naacp_1999_resolution.htm |title=NAACP 1999 Resolution |accessdate=2013-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128103322/http://www.aistm.org/naacp_1999_resolution.htm |archivedate=2012-11-28 |df= </ref>

In 2001, the United States Commission on Civil Rights|U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released an advisory opinion calling for an end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.<ref name=USCCR>cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/press/archives/2001/041601st.htm |title=Statement of the United States Commission on Civil Rights on the use of Native American images and nicknames as sports symbols |accessdate=2016-12-10|date=2001</ref>

Legal remedies
While all advocates for elimination of Native mascots agree that the practice is morally wrong, many do not find a basis for legal remedy. Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by African Americans and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The Cultural appropriation|appropriation of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular African Americans, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the "noble savage" honors Native Americans.<ref>cite journal|volume=56 |journal=UCLA Law Review |page=591 |title=Red: Racism and the American Indian |last=Berger |first=Bethany R. |year=2009 |url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423112932/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= </ref>

In February 2013, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR) filed a complaint with the United States Department of Education|US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR).

A legal claim of discrimination rests upon a group agreeing that a particular term or practice is offensive, thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming Native American heritage who say they are not offended. This raised the difficulty of Native American identity in the United States, also an evolving controversy.<ref name="Morris.2015"/>

Mainstream opinion reflects the function of identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team.

Some individuals who support the use of Native American mascots state that they are meant to be respectful, and to pay homage to Native American people. Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, then vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team, declared in the magazine ''Sports Illustrated'' that his team's name "symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership", and that the "Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people".<ref name="bar">cite journal| last=Emert| first=Phyllis Raybin| year=2003| url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| title=Native American Mascots: Racial Slur or Cherished Tradition?| journal=Respect (newsletter)| publisher=New Jersey State Bar Foundation| volume=2| issue=2 (Winter 2003)| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103052217/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| archivedate=2011-01-03| df=</ref>

However, many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful. Richard Lapchick, director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: "Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in Blackface|black face at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with Body painting|war paint on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?"<ref>cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lapchick/050825&num=0|title=Mascots are a matter of respect|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=February 6, 2013</ref>

Others claim Native American mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance. Chief Illiniwek, the former athletic symbol for the University of Illinois, became the subject of protest in 1988.<ref name="Spindel"/> In 1990 the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a dignified symbol: "His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty. The Chief keeps the memory of the people of a great Native American tribe alive for thousands of Illinoisans who otherwise would know little or nothing of them. However, the tribal costume was not of the Illinois Confederation, but that of the Lakota people|Lakota tribe. The Peoria (tribe)|Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma is the closest living descendants of the Illiniwek Confederacy. In response to requests by former Chief Illiniwek portrayer's to bring back occasional performances, Peoria Chief John P. Froman reaffirmed the tribe's position that Chief (Illiniwek) "was not in any way representative of Peoria culture".<ref>cite news| url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2013-05-07/updated-peoria-tribe-leader-doesnt-back-chief-return.html| title=Peoria tribe leader doesn't back Chief return| date=May 7, 2013| author=Christine Des Garennes| publisher=News-Gazette| accessdate=June 9, 2017</ref>

Financial impact of change
Many supporters of Native American mascots feel that the financial cost of changing mascots would far outweigh the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames ranging from T-shirts to beer cozies generate millions of dollars in sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless.<ref name="bar"/> The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools.<ref>cite news|url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120518/NEWS/205180322|title=State bans Native American mascots|date=May 18, 2012|first=Sanne|last=Specht|newspaper=Mail Tribune|accessdate=February 11, 2013</ref> Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. Clyde Bellecourt, when director of the American Indian Movement stated: "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawks, the chicken War bonnet|feather headdresses, people wearing Body painting|war paint and making these ridiculous Battle cry|war whoops with a tomahawk in one hand and a beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us. And the psychological impact it has, especially on our youth, is devastating."<ref name="bar"/>

A study done by the Emory University Goizueta Business School indicates that the growing unpopularity of Native American mascots is a financial drain for professional teams, losing money compared to more popular animal mascots.<ref>cite web|url=https://blogs.emory.edu/sportsmarketing/2013/12/19/the-financial-impact-of-mascots-on-sports-brands/?_ga=1.256951951.500422532.1397069844b|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020044121/https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/esma/2013/12/19/the-financial-impact-of-mascots-on-sports-brands/?_ga=1.256951951.500422532.1397069844b| archivedate=October 20, 2014| title=The Financial Impact of Mascots on Sports Brands|publisher=Emory University|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2014</ref>

Public opinion surveys
see also|Washington Redskins name opinion polls
A survey conducted in 2002 by Harris Insights & Analytics|The Harris Poll for Sports Illustrated (SI) found that 81 percent of Native Americans who live outside traditional Indian reservations and 53 percent of Indians on reservations did not find the images discriminatory. The authors of the article concluded that "Although most Native American activists and tribal leaders consider Indian team names and mascots offensive, neither Native Americans in general nor a cross section of U.S. sports fans agree". According to the article, "There is a near total disconnect between Indian activists and the Native American population on this issue." An Indian activist commented on the results saying "that Native Americans' self-esteem has fallen so low that they don't even know when they're being insulted".<ref name=PriceWoo>cite news| url = https://www.si.com/vault/2002/03/04/8100154/the-indian-wars-the-campaign-against-indian-nicknames-and-mascots-presumes-that-they-offend-native-americansbut-do-they-we-took-a-poll-and-you-wont-believe-the-results| author = S.L.

More recent surveys, rather than addressing the larger issue, have targeted the controversy over the name of the Washington Redskins, asking if the word is offensive or if it should be changed. By a large majority (71–89 percent), public opinion has maintained that the name should not change. However, more than half (53–59 percent) agree that "redskin" is not an appropriate term for Native Americans.<ref>cite web| url=http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=b41b9bde-1b19-40f7-af86-0b585eb8df03| title=Results of SurveyUSA News Poll #20802| date=October 15, 2013| accessdate=November 13, 2014</ref><ref>cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/06/25/National-Politics/Polling/release_246.xml?44|title=Should the Washington Redskins change their name?|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post</ref><ref>cite news|url=http://www.wusa9.com/longform/sports/nfl/2014/09/25/nfl-washington-redskins-name-survey-dc-maryland-virginia-response/16098841/|title=DC Speaks: Keep Redskins name|author=Greg Cohen|publisher=WUSA|date=September 25, 2014</ref>

The survey most frequently cited by opponents of change as definitive of Native American opinion was performed in 2004 as part of the National Annenberg Election Survey. Among other questions regarding election year issues, respondents who identified themselves as being Native American were asked: "The professional football team in Washington calls itself the Washington Redskins. As a Native American, do you find that name offensive or doesn't it bother you?" In response, ninety percent replied that the name did not bother them, while nine percent said that it was offensive, and one percent would not answer.<ref name="Annenberg.20140927">cite web |author=Kathleen Hall Jamieson Ph.D. |title=Most Indians Say Name of Washington "Redskins" Is Acceptable While 9 Percent Call It Offensive |url=http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/most-indians-say-name-of-washington-redskins-is-acceptable-while-9-percent-call-it-offensive/ |website=The Annenberg Public Policy Center |accessdate=September 27, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014154005/http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/most-indians-say-name-of-washington-redskins-is-acceptable-while-9-percent-call-it-offensive/ |archivedate=October 14, 2013 |deadurl=no |date=September 24, 2004</ref>  The methods used in this survey and the conclusions that can be drawn from it have been criticized by social scientists,<ref name="too">cite journal|author=Charles Springwood|title='I'm Indian Too!': Claiming Native American Identity, Crafting Authority in Mascot Debates|publisher=Journal of Sport and Social Issues|date=February 2004|volume=28|page=56|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0193732503261477</ref> Native American scholars<ref name="ClarkD.2005">cite journal|title=Indigenous Voice and Vision as Commodity in a Mass-Consumption Society: The Colonial Politics of Public Opinion Polling|author=D.

A flaw unique to polls of Native Americans is they rely upon self-identification to select the target population. In an editorial in the The Herald-Times|Bloomington Herald Times, Steve Russell (an enrolled Cherokee citizen and associate professor of criminal justice at Indiana University), states that both SI and Annenberg's samples of "self-identified Native Americans&nbsp;... includes plenty of people who have nothing to do with Indians".<ref>cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~mstd/e320/amerind/flap.html|title=Some collected materials about the NCAA's decision to ban Indian sports mascots from the Indianapolis area|accessdate=January 27, 2013</ref> Individuals claiming to be Native American when they are not is well known in academic research, and people claiming Indian identity specifically to gain authority in the debate over sports mascots has been criticised.<ref name="too" />

At the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at California State University, San Bernardino a survey has conducted of 400 individuals whose identity as Native American was verified, finding that 67% agreed with the statement that "Redskins" is offensive and racist.

While protests began in the 1970s, national attention to the issue did not occur until widespread television coverage of college and professional games brought the behaviour of some fans to the attention of Native Americans. The appearance of the Atlanta Braves in the 1991 World Series and the Washington Redskins at the 1992 Super Bowl XXVI|Super Bowl prompted the largest response because the games were played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which has a large Native American population.<ref>cite web| url=http://miamioh.edu/about-miami/diversity/miami-tribe-relations/mascot-story/native-mascots/index.html| title=Native Mascots Become a National Controversy | publisher=Miami University of Ohio| accessdate=December 19, 2016</ref>

The documents most often cited to justifying the elimination of Native mascots are the advisory opinion by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005.<ref name=APA/><ref name=USCCR/> Neither of these documents refer to subjective perceptions of offensiveness, but to scientific evidence of harms and legal definitions of discrimination.

Individual school districts have responded to complaints by local Native American individuals and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades, or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition.

Relationships with tribes to retain Native names have been established at the high school level. Arapahoe High School (Centennial, Colorado) now uses a logo provided by the Arapaho Tribe of Wyoming, which initially included an agreement that the image would not be placed on the gym floor or any article of clothing. The latter provision has not always been observed, but the logo does not appear on the team uniforms. The agreement also includes tribal participation in school events. A similar agreement has been worked out between the Northern Arapahoe Tribe and the Strasburg High School " Indians" in Strasburg, Colorado.<ref>cite news| url=https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/05/14/indian-mascot-at-hs-gets-blessing-from-tribe-and-without-cultural-controversy-im-honored| title= Indian mascot at HS gets blessing from tribe — and without cultural controversy: 'I'm honored' | date=May 14, 2018| author=Dave Urbanski| publisher=KCNC-TV</ref>

An exceptional case is the Salamanca Central High School "Warriors" in the city of Salamanca (city), New York|Salamanca, New York. The city is within the boundaries of the Allegany Indian Reservation of the Seneca Nation of Indians, and 26% of the high school students are Native American. In 2001, when the commissioner of the New York State Education Department sent a letter to all New York school boards calling for the elimination of Native American mascots, the Seneca Nation Tribal Council joined with other members of the community in seeking to retain the Warrior imagery, although with individual differences of opinion. Salamanca may be unique in having a mixed but not fully integrated community, with the Warrior identity combining elements negotiated between the Seneca and non-Seneca population.  For example, the school logo now depicts a Seneca man, replacing the stereotypical Plains Indian warrior image that was used prior to 1978.<ref>cite journal| last=Taylor| first=Michael| title=THE SALAMANCA WARRIORS: A Case Study of an 'Exception to the Rule.'| journal=Journal of Anthropological Research| volume=67| issue=2| year=2011| pages=245–265| jstor=41303285</ref>

Some college teams voluntarily changed their names and mascots. Stanford University had "The Stanford Indian" as its mascot from 1930 to 1972. Today Stanford's athletic team identity is built around the "Stanford Cardinal", reflecting the primary school colors|school color that has been used from the earliest days, while the unofficial mascot shown on its primary logo is the Stanford Tree.<ref>cite web|title=Color: Stanford Identity Toolkit|url=http://identity.stanford.edu/color.html|accessdate=7 October 2017</ref> Another early change was the "Saltine Warrior#Mascot|Saltine Warrior" that represented Syracuse University from 1931 until 1978. After a brief attempt to use a Roman warrior, the mascot became Otto the Orange for the school color. Miami University began discussion regarding the propriety of the Redskins name and images in 1972, and changed its team nickname to Miami RedHawks|RedHawks in 1996.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.miami.muohio.edu/about-miami/diversity/miami-tribe-relations/mascot-story/index.html|title=Mascot Story|accessdate=February 5, 2013|publisher=Miami University</ref>

Although the team name of Eastern Michigan University changed from the Hurons to the Eagles in 1991, the change remained controversial as some students and alumni sought to restore it. In 2012, the university president brought back the Hurons logo, which was placed inside a flap of the band uniforms, along with another historic logo, with the stated intent of recognizing the past. However, the return of the Hurons logo has prompted protests from Native Americans at the university and in the local community, who state that the old mascot promotes stereotypes and hostility.<ref>cite news| url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/16/eastern-michigan-university-hurons-logo/28797179/| title=Native Americans rally against Hurons logo at EMU| first=Kim| last=Kozlowski| newspaper=The Detroit News| date=June 16, 2015</ref><ref>cite news| url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/16/huron-logo-emu/28828217/| title=Community wants logo off EMU band uniforms| first=David| last=Jesse| newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=June 16, 2015</ref>

Marquette University changed their team name from the Warriors to the Golden Eagles in 1994. The school's president stated: "We live in a different era than when the Warriors nickname was selected in 1954.

Chief Wahoo is part of an exhibit at the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia maintained by Ferris State University in Michigan. For Dr. David Pilgrim, a sociology professor at Ferris State and an expert in racial imagery, the symbol is a "red Sambo" that hardly differs from the caricatures of blacks popular in the Jim Crow era in which Wahoo was created, when such depictions of minority races were popularly used to inflame prejudice and justify discriminatory laws and behavior. Pilgrim explains how the exaggerated features serve their discriminatory purpose by emphasizing the differences of the depicted race, thereby reinforcing the idea that the caricaturized race is inferior.

Kansas City Chiefs

In 1963 the Kansas City Chiefs adopted a name referring to Native Americans, when the Dallas Texans (AFL) relocated. The team was named in honor of Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle who was instrumental in bringing the Texans to Kansas City, Missouri. Bartle earned his nickname as founder of a Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts honor camping society, Tribe of Mic-O-Say, in which he was "Chief" Lone Bear. In 1989 the Chiefs switched from Warpaint (mascot)|Warpaint, a Pinto horse ridden by a man in a feathered headdress, to their current mascot K. C. Wolf.

On June 18, 2014, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board voted to cancel the team's trademarks in a two to one decision that held that the term "redskins" is disparaging to a "substantial composite of Native Americans."<ref name=BelsonK.20140618>cite news|url=http://nyti.ms/1l2Wela|title=U.S. Patent Office Cancels Redskins Trademark Registration|author1=Ken Belson|author2=Edward Wyatt|date=June 18, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=November 15, 2017</ref><ref name=GormanD.20140801>cite news| url=http://www.inta.org/INTABulletin/Pages/UNITEDSTATESInaSplitDecisiontheTTABAffirmsCancellationofREDSKINSTrademarks.aspx| title=UNITED STATES: In a Split Decision, the TTAB Affirms Cancellation of REDSKINS Trademarks| work=INTA Journal| publisher=International Trademark Association| author=Danielle Gorman| date=August 1, 2014| volume=69| issue=14| accessdate=November 15, 2017</ref> However, on June 19, 2017 in a separate case (Matal v.

The year 2017 was marked by numerous professional sports player protests during the national anthem against racism and police brutality. As a result, criticism of the stereotyping of Native Americans as mascots also increased, including the decision to have the Washington Redskins host a game on Thanksgiving.<ref>Cite news| issn = 0027-8378| last = Zirin| first = Dave| title = By Having the Washington R*dskins Host a Game on Thanksgiving, NFL Owners Show Their True Colors| magazine = The Nation| accessdate = November 24, 2017| date = November 17, 2017| url = https://www.thenation.com/article/by-having-the-washington-rdskins-host-a-game-on-thanksgiving-nfl-owners-show-their-true-colors/</ref> 

In response to the possibility that the team could return to the District of Columbia in a new stadium, a coalition of nine civil rights organizations issued a statement in August, 2018 that such a move should not be made "unless the team agrees to drop the "R-word" racial slur as its mascot."<ref name="NAACP.2018">cite web| url=https://www.naacp.org/latest/leading-national-civil-rights-racial-justice-organizations-announce-joint-opposition-washington-nfl-team-locating-new-stadium-district-columbia/| title=Leading National Civil Rights and Racial Justice Organizations Announce Joint Opposition to Washington NFL Team Locating New Stadium in District of Columbia| date=August 24, 2018| website=NAACP</ref>

Other issues

=Stereotyping by rival fans=
In addition to the behavior of the teams that have Native American names or mascots, their rivals often invoke racist stereotypes.

In December 2013 when the Washington Redskins played the Kansas City Chiefs an employee of a Sonic Drive-In in Missouri placed a message outside that used scalping, Indian reservation|reservations and Whisky|whiskey to disparage the "Redskins". It was quickly removed with the owner's apologies.<ref>cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2520773/Sonic-Drive-restaurant-upsets-racist-sign-scalp-Washington-Redskins.html|title=Fast food restaurant upsets customers with racist sign promising that the Kansas City Chiefs would 'scalp' the Washington Redskins|publisher=Daily Mail|first=Sara|last=Malm|date=9 December 2013|location=London</ref> A rubber severed "Indian" head impaled on a knife has been used by a sports fan in Philadelphia to taunt rival teams with Native American mascots.<ref>cite web|url=http://nativeappropriations.com/2010/06/thanks-for-the-severed-head-youve-proved-my-point.html|title=Thanks for the severed head.

=Varying degrees of offensiveness=
To further complicate this controversy, many feel that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots. The nature and degree of stereotyping varies depending upon the name of the team, the logo, the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the Cleveland Indians' Chief Wahoo;<ref>cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=5437|title=Coalition Of Religious Investors Fight Baseball Team Logo|date=July 10, 1997|accessdate=January 18, 2013|publisher=Catholic Culture</ref> the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as redskin (slang)|Redskins or Squaws;<ref>cite web| url=http://www.dodgecountynews.com/archives/7311-Squaws-are-region-runner-upshost-first-round-of-state-Friday.html| title=Squaws are region runner-ups:host first round of state Friday| date=February 15, 2017 | accessdate=March 6, 2017| publisher=The Dodge County News Online</ref> or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures, such as the tomahawk chop.<ref>cite web| url=https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2013/5/1/4292152/yeah-the-tomahawk-chop-bugs-me-heres-why| title=Yeah, the "Tomahawk Chop" bugs me. Here's why| first=Mike| last=Bates| date=May 1, 2013| publisher=SBNation</ref>

The practices of individual schools and teams have changed in response to the controversy. A local example is Washington High School (Sioux Falls, South Dakota)|Washington High School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Many Native American images have been removed, and the "Warriors" nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has a "circle of courage" logo with eagle feathers and has also "updated" the murals of Chief Hollow Horn Bear in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at Sinte Gleska University in Mission, stated: "We had no objection to their utilizing those pictures as long as my great-grandfather was represented with honor and dignity." However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence of any such images.<ref>cite web| url=http://www.argusleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/stu-whitney/2015/01/17/whitney-sioux-falls-team-indian-nickname/21925163/| title=Does Washington High have nickname problem?| first=Stu| last=Whitney| date=January 17, 2015| publisher=Argus Leader</ref>
