Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dance|dancing. It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are Concert|live dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Pottery of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances. In the Baroque music|Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance). In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement (music)|movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka, ecossaise, Ballade (classical music)|ballade and polonaise.

Modern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century's Western Ballroom dance|ballroom and social dance music. During the early 20th century, ballroom dancing gained popularity among the working class who attended public dance halls. Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s. In the 1930s, called the Swing era, Swing music was the popular dance music in America. In the 1950s, rock and roll became the popular dance music. The late 1960s saw the rise of Soul music|soul and Rhythm and blues|R&B music. The rise of disco in the early 1970s led to dance music becoming popular with the public. By the late 1970s, electronic dance music was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of popular music commonly played in nightclubs, radio stations, concert|shows and raves. Many subgenres of electronic dance music have evolved.

Origins

Folk dance music is music accompanying Folk dance|traditional dance and may be contrasted with historical/classical, and popular/commercial dance music. An example of folk dance music in the United States is the old-time music played at square dances and contra dances.

Historical dance music

While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Pottery of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances such as Carol (music)|carols and the Estampie. The earliest of these surviving dances are almost as old as Western staff-based music notation.

=By period=

The Renaissance dance music was written for instruments such as the lute, viol, tabor (instrument)|tabor, pipe (instrument)|pipe, and the sackbut.

In the Baroque music|Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance). Examples of dances include the courante|French courante, sarabande, minuet and gigue. Collections of dances were often collected together as suite (music)|dance suites.

In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement (music)|movement in four-movement non-vocal works such as sonata (music)|sonatas, string quartets, and symphony|symphonies, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era, as the minuet evolved into the scherzo (literally, "joke"; a faster-paced minuet).

Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka and polonaise. Also in the romantic music era, the growth and development of ballet extended the composition of dance music to a new height. Frequently, dance music was a part of opera.

Popular dance music

Modern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century's Western Ballroom dance|ballroom and social dance music.

=By genre=
Dance music works often bear the name of the corresponding dance, e.g. waltzes, the Tango music|tango, the bolero, the can-can, minuets, salsa music|salsa, various kinds of jigs and the breakdown (music)|breakdown. Other dance forms include contradance, the merengue (music)|merengue (Dominican Republic), and the Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha. Often it is difficult to know whether the name of the music came first or the name of the dance.

Ballads are commonly chosen for slow-dance routines. However ballads have been commonly deemed as the opposite of dance music in terms of their tempo. Originally, the ballad was a type of dance as well (hence the name "ballad", from the same root as "ballroom" and "ballet"). Ballads are still danced on the Faeroe Islands.

Dansband
Main article|Dansband

"Dansband" ("Dance band") is a term in Swedish language|Swedish for bands who play a kind of popular music, "dansbandsmusik" ("Dance band music"), to partner dance to. These terms came into use around 1970, and before that, many of the bands were classified as "pop music|pop groups". This type of music is mostly popular in the Nordic countries.

Disco
Main article|Disco

Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, Soul music|soul, Pop music|pop, and Salsa music|salsa. It was most popular during the mid to late 1970s, though it has had brief resurgences afterwards. It inspired the electronic dance music genre.

Electronic

Main article|Electronic dance music

By 1981, a new form of dance music was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of popular music commonly played in dance music nightclubs, radio stations, concert|shows and raves. During its gradual decline in the late 1970s, disco became influenced by computerization (the first notable fully synthesized disco hit was "I Feel Love" by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte with lyrics by Donna Summer).<ref>cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct09/articles/classictracks_1009.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909013758/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct09/articles/classictracks_1009.htm |archivedate=2013-09-09 |df= </ref> Music loop|Looping, sampling (music)|sampling and segueing as found in disco continued to be used as creative techniques within trance music, techno|techno music and especially house music.

Electronic dance music experienced a boom after the proliferation of personal computers in the 1980s, manifest in the dance element of Tony Wilson's Haçienda scene (in Manchester) and London clubs like Delirium, The Trip, and Shoom. The ongoing influence of Shoom can be seen in its 25th anniversary party, held at Cable Nightclub on 8 December 2012, which sold out in four days. The scene rapidly expanded to the Summer Of Love in Ibiza, which became the European capital of house and trance. Clubs like Sundissential and Manumission became household names with British, German and Italian tourists.

Many music genres that made use of electronic instruments developed into contemporary styles mainly due to the MIDI protocol, which enabled computers, synthesizers, sound cards, samplers, and drum machines to interact with each other and achieve the full synchronization of sounds. Electronic dance music is typically composed using computers and synthesizers, and rarely has any physical musical instrument|instruments. Instead, this is replaced by Digital data|digital or electronic musical instrument|electronic sounds, with a 4/4 beat. Many producers of this kind of music however, such as Darren Tate and MJ Cole, were trained in classical music before they moved into the electronic medium.

Associated with dance music are usually commercial tracks that may not easily be categorized, such as "The Power (Snap! song)|The Power" by Snap!, "No Limit (2 Unlimited song)|No Limit" by 2 Unlimited, "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" by C+C Music Factory, and the Beatmasters' "Rok da House" but the term "dance music" is applied to many forms of electronic music, both commercial and non-commercial.

Some of the most popular upbeat genres include house music|house, techno, Drum and bass|drum & bass, Oldschool jungle|jungle, Hardcore techno|hardcore, electronica, Industrial music|industrial, breakbeat, Trance music|trance, psychedelic trance, UK garage and Electro (music)|electro. There are also much slower styles, such as downtempo, Chill out music|chillout and nu jazz.

Many subgenres of electronic dance music have evolved. Subgenres of House music|house include acid house, electro house, hard house, funky house, deep house, tribal house, hip house, tech house and US garage. Subgenres of Drum and bass|drum & bass include techstep, hardstep, jump-up (drum and bass)|jump-up, Intelligent drum and bass|intelligent D&B/atmospheric D&B, liquid funk, sambass, drumfunk, neurofunk and ragga jungle. Subgenres of other styles include progressive breaks, booty bass, Goa trance, hard trance, hardstyle, minimal techno, Gabber|gabber techno, breakcore, broken beat, trip hop, folktronica and Glitch (music)|glitch. Speed garage, breakstep, 2-step garage|2-step, Bassline (music genre)|bassline, Grime (music)|grime, UK funky, future garage and the reggae-inspired dubstep are all subgenres of UK garage.
