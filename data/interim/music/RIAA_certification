In the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) awards certification based on the number of albums and single (music)|singles sold through retail and other ancillary markets.<ref name="RIAA Certification Criteria">[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=criteria RIAA certification criteria]. Retrieved on September 19, 2006</ref> Other countries have similar awards (see music recording sales certification). Certification is not automatic; for an award to be made, the record label must request certification.<ref name=certification>cite web |url=https://riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=certification |title=Apply - RIAA |website=RIAA.com |access-date=2016-01-23</ref> The audit is conducted against net shipments after returns (most often an artist's royalty statement is used), which includes albums sold directly to retailers and one-stops, direct-to-consumer sales (music clubs and mail order) and other outlets.

A Music recording sales certification|Gold record is a single or album that has sold 500,000 units (records, tapes or compact discs). The award was launched in 1958;<ref name="riaa history">cite web |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701162808/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=historyx |archivedate= July 1, 2007 |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=historyx |title=History Of The Awards |work=RIAA.com</ref> originally, the requirement for a Gold single was one million units sold and a Gold album represented $1 million in sales (at wholesale value, around a third of the list price).<ref name="white" /> In 1975, the additional requirement of 500,000 units sold was added for Gold albums.<ref name="white" /> Reflecting growth in record sales, the Platinum award was added in 1976 for albums selling one million units, and singles selling two million units.<ref name="white">cite book |title=The Billboard Book of Gold & Platinum Records |author=Adam White |publisher=Billboard Books |date= 1990 |page=viii |isbn= 978-0711921962</ref><ref>cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-extra-where-thriller-ranks-193809485.html  |title=Chart Watch Extra: Where "Thriller" Ranks |first=Paul|last=Grein |work=Chart Watch |publisher=Yahoo Music |date=Nov 30, 2012 |accessdate=December 5, 2012</ref> The Multi-Platinum award was introduced in 1984, signifying multiple Platinum levels of albums and singles.<ref>cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XTo8AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA308#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Rock and Roll: An Introduction|authors= Michael Campbell, James Brody |page=308 |publisher=Thomson Schirmer |edition=2nd |year=2008|isbn=9781111794538</ref> In 1989, the sales thresholds for singles were reduced to 500,000 for Gold and 1,000,000 for Platinum, reflecting a decrease in sales of singles.<ref>cite book |title=The Billboard Book of Gold & Platinum Records |author=Adam White |publisher=Billboard Books |date= 1990 |page=3|isbn= 978-0711921962</ref> In 1992, RIAA began counting each disc in a multi-disc set as one unit toward certification.  Reflecting additional growth in music sales, the Diamond award was instituted in 1999 for albums or singles selling ten million units.<ref name="riaa history"/>  Because of these changes in criteria, the sales level associated with a particular award depends on when the award was made.

Nielsen SoundScan figures are not used in RIAA certification; the RIAA system predates Nielsen SoundScan and includes sales outlets Nielsen misses.citation needed|date=April 2015 Prior to Nielsen SoundScan, RIAA certification was the only audited and verifiable system for tracking music sales in the U.S.; it is still the only system capable of tracking 100% of sales (albeit as shipments less returns, not actual sales like Nielsen SoundScan).citation needed|date=April 2015 This system has allowed, at times, for record labels to promote an album as Gold or Platinum simply based on large shipments.  For instance, in 1978 the ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (soundtrack)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' soundtrack shipped Platinum but was a sales bust, with two million returns.<ref>Hollie, Pamela. "Record Industry: Big Changes" ''The New York Times'' January 12, 1980: 27</ref> Similarly, all four solo albums by the members of Kiss (band)|Kiss simultaneously shipped Platinum that same year but did not reach the top 20 of the Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200 album chart.<ref>cite book |title=Kiss and Sell: The Making of a Supergroup |last=Lendt |first=C.K. |year=1997 |page=95 </ref> The following year, the RIAA began requiring 120 days from the release date before recordings were eligible for certification, although that requirement has been reduced over the years and currently stands at 30 days. Sony Music Entertainment|Sony was widely criticized in 1995 for hyping Michael Jackson's double album ''HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I|HIStory'' as five times Platinum, based on shipments of 2.5 million and using the RIAA's recently adopted practice of counting each disc toward certification, while SoundScan was reporting only 1.3 million copies sold.<ref>cite web|last=Farber |first=Jim |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/buy-jax-pyramid-scheme-platinum-status-symbol-history-marking-5-million-albums-sold-proves-worthless-fool-gold-article-1.704078 |title=Don't Buy into Jax' Pyramid Scheme: Platinum-Status Symbol on 'History' Marking Over 5-million Albums Sold Proves to Be as Worthless as Fool's Gold |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=1995-09-11 |accessdate=2011-08-05</ref> A similar discrepancy between shipments and sales was reported with ''The Lion King (soundtrack)|The Lion King'' soundtrack.<ref>cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-15/entertainment/ca-20083_1_lion-king|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Sold, Shipped, What's the Diff? : About 2 million albums, in the case of 'The Lion King,' pointing up the disparity between industry's sales tally and SoundScan's|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 15, 1995|page=67|accessdate=June 24, 2012</ref>

List of certifications

=Records=
* 500,000 units: Gold album
* 1,000,000 units: Platinum album
* 2,000,000 units: Multi-Platinum album

For further information, see Music recording sales certification.

Multi-disc
Multi-disc albums are counted once for each disc within the album if it is over 100 minutes in length or is from the vinyl era. For example, each copy of Aaliyah's catalog, The Smashing Pumpkins's ''Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness'' (running time of 121:39), and OutKast's ''Speakerboxxx/The Love Below'' (running time of 134:56), both double albums, were counted twice, meaning each album was certified diamond after 5 million copies were shipped. Pink Floyd's ''The Wall'' and The Beatles' ''The Beatles (album)|White Album'', both vinyl-era, are also counted double even though their running times are under the minimum requirement. Rules may or may not apply depending on most recent staff within the Distributions position.

Spanish
Since 2000, the RIAA also awards ''Los Premios de Oro y De Platino'' (Gold and Platinum Awards in Spanish language|Spanish)  to Latin music (genre)|Latin albums which are defined by the RIAA as a type of product that features at least 51% of content in Spanish.<ref name="about">Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/keystatistics.php?content_selector=research-about|title=About|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|accessdate=August 12, 2015</ref>

=Singles=
Standard singles are certified:
* Gold when it ships 500,000 copies
* Platinum when it ships 1,000,000 copies
* Multi-Platinum when it ships at least 2,000,000 copies

Note: The number of sales required to qualify for Gold and Platinum discs was higher prior to January 1, 1989. The thresholds were previously 1,000,000 units (Gold) and 2,000,000 units (Platinum).<ref>cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-05-14/business/fi-188_1_singles-riaa-platinum|title=New Golden Rule: 500,000 Sales Mark for All Singles|last=Grein|first=Paul|date=May 14, 1989|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=12 November 2010</ref>

Digital singles are certified:
* Gold means 500,000 certification units
* Platinum means 1,000,000 certification units
* Multi-Platinum means 2,000,000+ certification units

From 2004 through July 2006, the certification level was 100,000 downloads for Gold and 200,000 for Platinum. When the RIAA changed the certification standards to match retail distribution in August 2006, all Platinum and Multi-Platinum awards for a digital release were withdrawn. Gold certifications, however, were not, meaning a song that was downloaded over 100,000 times and certified so by the RIAA during that time frame retains its Gold status.<ref>cite book |title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2008 |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2009 |edition=12th |isbn=0-89820-180-2 |page=14</ref>

Starting May 9, 2013, RIAA certifications for singles in the "digital" category include on-demand audio and/or video song streams in addition to downloads at a rate of 100 streams=1 certification "unit".<ref>cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?content_selector=riaa-news-gold-and-platinum&news_month_filter=5&news_year_filter=2013&id=C19496E7-CEC0-C453-D8A1-BD80E56E610F|title=RIAA Adds Digital Streams To Historic Gold & Platinum Awards|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=May 9, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019233038/http://riaa.com/newsitem.php?content_selector=riaa-news-gold-and-platinum&news_month_filter=5&news_year_filter=2013&id=C19496E7-CEC0-C453-D8A1-BD80E56E610F|archivedate=October 19, 2014|df=</ref><ref>cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=new-combined-GP |title=NEW "COMBINED" DIGITAL SINGLE AWARD|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=May 10, 2013</ref> On January 2, 2016, this rate was updated to 150 streams = 1 certification unit.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DIGITAL-SINGLE-AWARD-RIAA-AND-GRF-CERTIFICATION-AUDIT-REQUIREMENTS.pdf |title=RIAA and GR&F Certification Audit Requirements: RIAA Digital Single Award|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|date=January 2, 2016</ref>

Latin digital singles are certified:
* Disco de Oro (Gold) means 30,000 certification units
* Disco de Platino (Platinum) means 60,000 certification units
* Disco de Multi-Platino (Multi-Platinum) means 120,000+ certification units

The Latin Digital Single Awards began on December 20, 2013. As with the digital sales, 100 streams count as one download sale.<ref name=spanishsingles/>

=Video Longform=
Along with albums, digital albums, and singles there is another classification of music release called "Video Longform." This release format includes DVD and VHS releases, and certain live albums and compilation albums. The certification criteria are slightly different from other styles.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/riaa/video.jsp |title=Billboard.com Latest Video Longform Certifications |accessdate=2008-05-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519083529/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/riaa/video.jsp |archivedate=May 19, 2008 |df=  Retrieved on May 14, 2008</ref>

*Gold: 50,000 copies
*Platinum: 100,000 copies
* Multi-Platinum: 200,000 copies

= Video Box Set =
The video box set (or "Multi-Box Music Video Set") award is a classification for video compilations that include three or more videos that are grouped and marketed together as a set.  Like Video Longform, this includes DVD and VHS releases and the certification criteria is the same. Each individual video within set is counted as one toward certification.<ref>Cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/about-awards/|title=About the Awards - RIAA|work=RIAA|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-US</ref> 

*Gold: 50,000 copies
*Platinum: 100,000 copies
* Multi-Platinum: 200,000 copies

The best-selling video box set as certified by the RIAA is The Rolling Stones' ''Four Flicks'' DVD compilation from their Licks Tour|Licks World Tour, with a 19X Multi-Platinum designation.  This was likely achieved due to exclusive distribution rights owned by Best Buy by their short-lived music production company, Redline Entertainment.<ref>Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jxEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=tga+entertainment+best+buy&source=bl&ots=dhBPus0NtE&sig=pp5d4rkpAHTgMDpaTZ1cZSv2Wso&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi45IzJt_HcAhXsm-AKHV9tDaYQ6AEwBHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=tga%20entertainment%20best%20buy&f=false|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=2003-10-18|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en</ref><ref>Cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=&ti=&lab=&genre=&format=Video+Boxset&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH&col=highest_level&ord=desc#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|work=RIAA|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-US</ref>

Note: The RIAA provides the [https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?advance_search=1&tab_active=awards_by_artist&format_option=album-ep&type_option=ST#search_section Detailed List of Artists with Most Album Certified Units]

anchor|Artists with the most Gold, Platinum and Multi-Platinum singles<!-- possible incoming links: next section had this title from March 2006 to March 2010 -->anchor|Artists with the most certifications of Gold, Platinum and Multi-Platinum singles as of January 2011<!-- possible incoming links: next section had this title from January 2011 to January 2016 -->

Artists with the most single certifications
Singles that have been certified Gold might receive additional certifications for achieving Platinum and Multi-Platinum levels.  For example, Eminem has had 13 singles certified Gold, 8 of which went on to achieve Platinum certification as well.

This list includes the RIAA formats 'Single','12 inch single' and 'Video Single'.  This list includes singles of the RIAA types 'standard' and 'digital'.
*Very few artists ever received a Gold 12-inch single (Donna Summer, Barbra Streisand for "Enough Is Enough", and Madonna for "Angel"/"Into The Groove")
*12 inch singles were given a Gold certification after sales of 500,000 or more copies sold. This took place back when more 12-inch singles were manufactured and sold.

This table tracks artists with some number of singles that have received at least twenty total certifications.
