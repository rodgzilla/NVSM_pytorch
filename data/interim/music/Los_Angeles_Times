The ''Los Angeles Times'' (sometimes abbreviated as ''LA Times'' or ''L.A. Times'') is a daily newspaper which has been published in Los Angeles, California, since 1881. It has the fourth-largest circulation among list of newspapers in the United States|United States newspapers, and is the largest U.S. newspaper not headquartered on the east coast.<ref>cite web|title=The 10 Most Popular Daily Newspapers In The United States|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-10-most-popular-daily-newspapers-in-the-united-states.html|accessdate=October 24, 2017</ref> The paper is known for its coverage of issues particularly salient to the U.S. west coast, such as immigration trends and natural disasters. It has won more than 40 Pulitzer Prizes for its coverage of these and other issues. as of|2018|June|18|df=US, ownership of the paper is controlled by Patrick Soon-Shiong, and the executive editor is Norman Pearlstine.<ref name=":0">Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/us/norman-pearlstine-los-angeles-times.html|title=Norman Pearlstine Named Editor of The Los Angeles Times|last=Arango|first=Tim|date=2018-06-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en</ref>

In the nineteenth century, the paper was known for its civic boosterism and opposition to unions, the latter of which led to the bombing of its headquarters in 1910. The paper's profile grew substantially in the 1960s under publisher Otis Chandler, who adopted a more national focus. In recent decades, the paper's readership has declined and it has been beset by a series of ownership changes, staff reductions, and other controversies. In January 2018, the paper's staff voted to unionize, and in July 2018 the paper moved out of its historic downtown headquarters to a facility near Los Angeles International Airport.

=Otis era=
The ''Times'' was first published on December 4, 1881, as the ''Los Angeles Daily Times'' under the direction of Nathan Cole Jr. and Thomas Gardiner (publisher)|Thomas Gardiner. It was first printed at the Mirror printing plant, owned by Jesse Yarnell and T.J. Caystile. Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the paper over to the Mirror Company. In the meantime, S. J. Mathes had joined the firm, and it was at his insistence that the ''Times'' continued publication. In July 1882, Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis moved from Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara to become the paper's editor.<ref name=LAT1923>[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=354598012&sid=50&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "Mirror Acorn, 'Times' Oak," ''Los Angeles Times,'' October 23, 1923, page II-1] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> Otis made the ''Times'' a financial success.

Historian Kevin Starr wrote that Otis was a businessman "capable of manipulating the entire apparatus of politics and public opinion for his own enrichment".<ref>

Toward those ends, the paper supported efforts to expand the city's water supply by California Water Wars|acquiring the rights to the water supply of the distant Owens Valley.

The efforts of the ''Times'' to fight local unions led to the October 1, 1910 Los Angeles Times bombing|bombing of its headquarters, killing twenty-one people. Two union leaders, McNamara brothers|James and Joseph McNamara, were charged. The American Federation of Labor hired noted trial attorney Clarence Darrow to represent the brothers, who eventually pleaded guilty.

Otis fastened a bronze eagle on top of a high frieze of the new ''Times'' headquarters building designed by Gordon Kaufmann, proclaiming anew the credo written by his wife, Eliza: "Stand Fast, Stand Firm, Stand Sure, Stand True."<ref>cite book|last=Berges|first=Marshall|title=The Life and Times of Los Angeles: A Newspaper, A Family and A City|publisher=Atheneum|location=New York|page=25</ref><ref name="answers.com">[http://www.answers.com/topic/clarence-darrow Clarence Darrow: Biography and Much More from Answers.com<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.answers.com</ref>

=Chandler era=
Upon Otis's death in 1917, his son-in-law, Harry Chandler, took control as publisher of the ''Times''. Harry Chandler was succeeded in 1944 by his son, Norman Chandler, who ran the paper during the rapid growth of post-war Los Angeles. Norman's wife, Dorothy Buffum Chandler, became active in civic affairs and led the effort to build the Los Angeles Music Center, whose main concert hall was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in her honor. Family members are buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery near Paramount Studios. The site also includes a memorial to the Times Building bombing victims.

The fourth generation of family publishers, Otis Chandler, held that position from 1960 to 1980. Otis Chandler sought legitimacy and recognition for his family's paper, often forgotten in the power centers of the Northeastern United States due to its geographic and cultural distance. He sought to remake the paper in the model of the nation's most respected newspapers, notably ''The New York Times'' and ''The Washington Post''.

</ref> Otis Chandler increased the size and pay of the reporting staff and expanded its national and international reporting. In 1962, the paper joined with ''The Washington Post'' to form the Los Angeles Times–Washington Post News Service to syndicate articles from both papers for other news organizations. He also toned down the unyielding conservatism that had characterized the paper over the years, adopting a much more centrist editorial stance.

During the 1960s, the paper won four Pulitzer Prizes, more than its previous nine decades combined.

Writing in 2013 about the pattern of newspaper ownership by founding families, ''Times'' reporter Michael Hiltzik said that:

<blockquote>The first generations bought or founded their local paper for profits and also social and political influence (which often brought more profits). Their children enjoyed both profits and influence, but as the families grew larger, the later generations found that only one or two branches got the power, and everyone else got a share of the money. Eventually the coupon-clipping branches realized that they could make more money investing in something other than newspapers. Under their pressure the companies went public, or split apart, or disappeared. That's the pattern followed over more than a century by the ''Los Angeles Times'' under the Chandler family.<ref>cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hiltzik-20130807,0,2277462.column|title=Washington Post Buy: Can Jeff Bezos Fix Newspapers' Business Model?|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=October 6, 2014|first=Michael|last=Hiltzik|date=August 6, 2013</ref>
</blockquote>

The paper's early history and subsequent transformation was chronicled in an unauthorized history ''Thinking Big'' (1977, ISBN|0-399-11766-0), and was one of four organizations profiled by David Halberstam in ''The Powers That Be (book)|The Powers That Be'' (1979, ISBN|0-394-50381-3; 2000 reprint ISBN|0-252-06941-2). It has also been the whole or partial subject of nearly thirty dissertations in communications or social science in the past four decades.<ref>''ProQuest Dissertation Abstracts''. Retrieved June 8, 2007.</ref>

Decline
The Los Angeles Times began a decline with Los Angeles itself with the decline in military production at the end of the Cold War. It faced hiring freezes in 1991-1992.

Another major decision at the same time was to cut the range of circulation. They cut circulation in California's Central Valley, Nevada, Arizona and then the San Diego edition.

The ''Los Angeles Times'' was beset in the first decade of the 21st century by a change in ownership, a bankruptcy, a rapid succession of editors, reductions in staff, decreases in paid circulation, the need to increase its Web presence, and a series of controversies.

For two days in 2005, the ''Times'' experimented with Wikitorial, the first Wiki by a major news organization to allow readers to combine forces to produce their own editorial pieces. It was shut down after being besieged it with inappropriate material.citation needed|date=April 2018

Ownership

In 2000, the Times-Mirror Company, publisher of the ''Times,'' was purchased by the Tribune Company of Chicago, Illinois, placing the paper in co-ownership with then-WB (now CW Television Network|CW)-affiliated KTLA, which Tribune acquired in 1985.<ref name=Tribune>cite news|title=Tribune called on to sell L.A.

On April 2, 2007, the Tribune Company announced its acceptance of real estate entrepreneur Sam Zell's offer to buy the ''Chicago Tribune'',  the ''Los Angeles Times'', and all other company assets. Zell announced that he would sell the Chicago Cubs baseball club. He put up for sale the company's 25 percent interest in Comcast SportsNet Chicago. Until shareholder approval was received, Los Angeles billionaires Ron Burkle and Eli Broad had the right to submit a higher bid, in which case Zell would have received a $25&nbsp;million buyout fee.<ref>cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/324173,CST-NWS-Trib03.article |title=Tribune goes to Zell |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=April 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918204150/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/324173%2CCST-NWS-Trib03.article |archivedate=September 18, 2008 |df= </ref>

In December 2008, the Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy was a result of declining advertising revenue and a debt load of $12.9&nbsp;billion, much of it incurred when the paper was taken private by Zell.<ref>cite web| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/09/business/fi-tribune9| title=Owner of L.A.

Editorial changes and staff reductions
John Carroll (journalist)|John Carroll, former editor of the ''Baltimore Sun'', was brought in to restore the luster of the newspaper. During his reign at the  ''Times'' he eliminated more than 200 jobs, but despite an operating profit margin of 20 percent, the Tribune executives were unsatisfied with returns, and by 2005 Carroll had left the newspaper. His successor, Dean Baquet, refused to impose the additional cutbacks mandated by the Tribune Company.

Baquet was the first African-American to hold this type of editorial position at a top-tier daily. During Baquet and Carroll's time at the paper, it won 13 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other paper but ''The New York Times''.<ref>

</ref> However, Baquet was removed from the editorship for not meeting the demands of the Tribune Group—as was publisher Jeffrey Johnson—and was replaced by James O'Shea of the ''Chicago Tribune''. O'Shea himself left in January 2008 after a budget dispute with publisher David Hiller.

The paper's content and design style was overhauled several times in attempts to increase circulation. In 2000, a major change reorganized the news sections (related news was put closer together) and changed the "Local" section to the "California" section with more extensive coverage. Another major change in 2005 saw the Sunday "Opinion" section retitled the Sunday "Current" section, with a radical change in its presentation and featured columnists. There were regular cross-promotions with Tribune-owned television station KTLA to bring evening-news viewers into the ''Times'' fold.

The paper reported on July 3, 2008, that it planned to cut 250 jobs by Labor Day and reduce the number of published pages by 15 percent.<ref>

Some observers believed that the drop was due to the retirement of circulation director Bert Tiffany.

In early 2006, the ''Times'' closed its San Fernando Valley printing plant, leaving press operations to the Olympic plant and to  Orange County, California|Orange County. Also in 2006, the ''Times'' announced its circulation had fallen to 851,532, down 5.4 percent from 2005. The ''Times's'' loss of circulation was the largest of the top ten newspapers in the U.S.<ref>

Despite the circulation decline, many in the media industry lauded the newspaper's effort to decrease its reliance on "other-paid" circulation in favor of building its "individually paid" circulation base—which showed a marginal increase in a circulation audit. This distinction reflected the difference between, for example, copies distributed to hotel guests free of charge (other-paid) versus subscriptions and single-copy sales (individually paid).citation needed|date=November 2010

Other controversies
It was revealed in 1999 that a revenue-sharing arrangement was in place between the ''Times'' and Staples Center in the preparation of a 168-page magazine about the opening of the sports arena. The magazine's editors and writers were not informed of the agreement, which breached the Chinese wall that traditionally has separated advertising from journalistic functions at American newspapers. Publisher Mark Willes also had not prevented advertisers from pressuring reporters in other sections of the newspaper to write stories favorable to their point of view.<ref>

Michael Kinsley was hired as the Opinion and Editorial (Op-Ed) Editor in April 2004 to help improve the quality of the opinion pieces. His role was controversial, as he forced writers to take a more decisive stance on issues. In 2005, he created a Wikitorial, the first Wiki by a major news organization. Although it failed, readers could combine forces to produce their own editorial pieces. He resigned later that year.

The ''Times'' drew fire for a last-minute story before the California recall election, 2003|2003 California recall election alleging that gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger groped scores of women during his movie career. Columnist Jill Stewart wrote on the ''American Reporter'' website  that the ''Times'' did not do a story on allegations that former Governor Gray Davis had verbally and physically abused women in his office and that the Schwarzenegger story relied on a number of anonymous sources. Further, she said, four of the six alleged victims were not named. She also said that in the case of the Davis allegations, the ''Times'' decided against printing the Davis story because of its reliance on anonymous sources.<ref>

In November 2017, Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios blacklisted the ''Times'' from attending press screenings of its films, in retaliation for September 2017 reportage by the paper on Disney's political influence in the Anaheim area. The company considered the coverage to be "biased and inaccurate". As a sign of condemnation and solidarity, a number of major publications and writers, including ''The New York Times'',  ''Boston Globe'' critic Ty Burr, ''Washington Post'' blogger Alyssa Rosenberg, and the websites ''The A.V. Club'' and ''Flavorwire'', announced that they would boycott press screenings of future Disney films. The National Society of Film Critics, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, New York Film Critics Circle, and Boston Society of Film Critics jointly announced that Disney's films would be ineligible for their respective year-end awards unless the decision was reversed, condemning the decision as being "antithetical to the principles of a free press and [setting] a dangerous precedent in a time of already heightened hostility towards journalists". On November 7, 2017, Disney reversed its decision, stating that the company "had productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at the ''Los Angeles Times'' regarding our specific concerns".<ref>Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/07/disney-los-angeles-times-media-boycott|title=Disney's blackout of LA Times triggers boycott from media outlets|last=Carroll|first=Rory|date=2017-11-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077</ref><ref>Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2017/11/06/why-i-wont-be-reviewing-the-last-jedi-or-any-other-disney-movie-in-advance/|title=Why I won’t be reviewing ‘The Last Jedi,’ or any other Disney movie, in advance|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-07</ref><ref>Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/07/disney-los-angeles-times-media-boycott|title=Disney ends blackout of LA Times after boycott from media outlets|last=Carroll|first=Rory|date=2017-11-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077</ref>

Competition and rivalry
In the 19th century, the chief competition to the ''Times'' was the ''Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Herald,'' followed by the smaller ''Los Angeles Tribune.'' In December 1903, newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst began publishing the ''Los Angeles Examiner'' as a direct morning competitor to the ''Times.''<ref>cite web|url=http://www.ulwaf.com/LA-1900s/03.12.html |title=December 1903: Hearst's Examiner comes to L.A |publisher=Ulwaf.com |accessdate=October 21, 2012</ref> In the 20th century, the ''Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Express'' was an afternoon competitor, as was Manchester Boddy's '' Los Angeles Daily News (historic)|Los Angeles Daily News'', a Democratic newspaper.<ref name=RedInk>[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL11566287M/Red_Ink_White_Lies Red Ink, White Lies: The Rise and Fall of Los Angeles Newspapers, 1920–1962] by Rob Leicester Wagner, Dragonflyer Press, 2000.</ref>

By the mid-1940s, the ''Times'' was the leading newspaper in terms of circulation in the Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles metropolitan area. In 1948, it launched the ''Los Angeles Mirror,'' an afternoon tabloid, to compete with both the ''Daily News'' and the merged ''Herald-Express''. In 1954, the ''Mirror'' absorbed the ''Daily News''. The combined paper, the ''Mirror-News,'' ceased publication in 1962, when the Hearst afternoon Los Angeles Herald Examiner|''Herald-Express'' and the morning ''Los Angeles Examiner'' merged to become the ''Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Herald-Examiner''.<ref name="Pitt">Leonard Pitt and Dale Pitt, ''Los Angeles: A to Z,'' University of California Press, ISBN|0-520-20274-0.</ref> The ''Herald-Examiner'' published its last number in 1989. In 2014, the ''Los Angeles Register'', published by Freedom Communications, then-parent company of the ''Orange County Register'' was launched as a daily newspaper to compete with the ''Times''. By late September of the same year, the ''Los Angeles Register'' was folded.

At first it was called the "Trade Number," and in 1886 it featured a special press run of "extra scope and proportions"; that is, "a twenty-four-page paper, and we hope to make it the finest exponent of this [Southern California] country that ever existed."<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=319655972&sid=25&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "Our Annual Trade Number," ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 18, 1886, page 4] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> Two years later, the edition had grown to "forty-eight handsome pages (9x15 inches), [which] stitched for convenience and better preservation," was "equivalent to a 150-page book."<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=318936802&sid=26&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "Our Annual Edition," ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 21, 1888, page 4] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> The last use of the phrase ''Trade Number'' was in 1895, when the edition had grown to thirty-six pages split among three separate sections.<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=321696492&sid=34&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "General Contents," ''Los Angeles Times,'' January 1, 1895] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref>

The Midwinter Number drew acclamations from other newspapers, including this one from the ''Kansas City Star'' in 1923:

quote|It is made up of five magazines with a total of 240 pages – the maximum size possible under the postal regulations. It goes into every detail of information about Los Angeles and Southern California that the heart could desire. It is virtually a cyclopedia on the subject. It drips official statistics. In addition it verifies the statistics with a profusion of illustration. . . . it is a remarkable combination of guidebook and travel magazine.<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=328889372&sid=20&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP Quoted in "Highest Praise Given to 'Times,'" ''Los Angeles Times'', January 28, 1923, page II-12] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref>

In 1948 the Midwinter Edition, as it was then called, had grown to "7 big picture magazines in beautiful rotogravure reproduction."<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=420191701&sid=42&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP Display advertisement, ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 13, 1947] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> The last mention of the Midwinter Edition was in a ''Times'' advertisement on January 10, 1954.<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=452716872&sid=39&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "Bigger and Better Than Ever," page F-10] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref>

Midsummer
Between 1891 and 1895, the ''Times'' also issued a similar Midsummer Number, the first one with the theme "The Land and Its Fruits".<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=324708542&sid=18&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "'The Land and Its Fruits' — Our Harvest Number," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 5, 1891, page 6] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref> Because of its issue date in September, the edition was in 1891 called the Midsummer Harvest Number.<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=324707802&sid=24&Fmt=10&clientId=13322&RQT=309&VName=HNP "Ready Tomorrow," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 4, 1891, page 4] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''</ref>

Features
Among the ''Times''' staff are columnists Steve Lopez and Patt Morrison, television critic Mary McNamara and film critic Kenneth Turan. Sports columnists include Bill Plaschke, who is also a panelist on ESPN's ''Around the Horn'', and Helene Elliott, the first female sportswriter to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

One of the ''Times''' features is "Column One", a feature that appears daily on the front page to the left-hand side. Established in September 1968, it is a place for the weird and the interesting; in the ''How Far Can a Piano Fly?'' (a compilation of Column One stories) introduction, Patt Morrison writes that the column's purpose is to elicit a "Gee, that's interesting, I didn't know that" type of reaction.

The ''Times'' also embarked on a number of investigative journalism pieces. A series in December 2004 on the Martin Luther King, Jr. Multi-Service Ambulatory Care Center|King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles led to a Pulitzer Prize and a more thorough coverage of the hospital's troubled history. Lopez wrote a five-part series on the civic and humanitarian disgrace of Los Angeles' Skid Row, Los Angeles|Skid Row, which became the focus of a 2009 motion picture, ''The Soloist.'' It also won 62 awards at the SND awards.

From 1967 to 1972, the ''Times'' produced a Sunday Supplement (publishing)|supplement called ''Los Angeles Times Magazine|West'' magazine. ''West'' was recognized for its art design, which was directed by Mike Salisbury (who later went on to become art director of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine).<ref name=Heller>Heller, Steven. [https://designobserver.com/feature/go-west-young-art-director/7357 "Go West, Young Art Director,"] ''Design Observer'' (Sept. 23, 2008).</ref> From 2000 to 2012, the ''Times'' published the ''Los Angeles Times Magazine'', which started as a weekly and then became a monthly supplement. The magazine focused on stories and photos of people, places, style, and other cultural affairs occurring in Los Angeles and its surrounding cities and communities. Since 2014, ''The California Sunday Magazine'' has been included in the Sunday ''L.A. Times'' edition.

Book publishing
The Times Mirror Corporation has also owned a number of book publishers over the years including New American Library, C.V. Mosby, as well as Harry N. Abrams, Matthew Bender, and Jeppesen.<ref name=NAL />

In 1960, Times Mirror of Los Angeles bought the book publisher New American Library known for publishing affordable paperback reprints of classics and other scholarly works.<ref>cite book|last1=Korda|first1=Michael|title=Another life : a memoir of other people|date=1999|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0679456597|page=103|edition=1st</ref> The NAL continued to operate autonomously from New York and  within the Mirror Company.

The Times-Mirror Company was a founding owner of television station KTTV in  Los Angeles, which opened in January 1949. It became that station's sole owner in 1951, after re-acquiring the minority shares it had sold to CBS in 1948. Times-Mirror also purchased a former motion picture studio, Nassour Studios, in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood in 1950, which was then used to consolidate KTTV's operations. Later to be known as Metromedia Square, the studio was sold along with KTTV to Metromedia in 1963.

After a seven-year hiatus from the medium, the firm reactivated Times-Mirror Broadcasting Company with its 1970 purchase of the ''Dallas Times Herald'' and its radio and television stations, KRLD (AM)|KRLD-AM-KZPS|FM-TV in Dallas, Texas|Dallas.<ref>cite news|last=Storch|first=Charles|title=Times Mirror Selling Dallas Times Herald|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-06-27/business/8602150886_1_john-buzzetta-gloucester-county-times-dallas-times-herald|accessdate=June 26, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 27, 1986</ref> The Federal Communications Commission granted an exemption of its concentration of media ownership|cross-ownership policy and allowed Times-Mirror to retain the newspaper and the television outlet, which was renamed KDFW-TV.

Times-Mirror Broadcasting later acquired KTBC-TV in Austin, Texas in 1973;<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/72-OCR/1972-09-04-BC-OCR-Page-0006.pdf "Johnson family sells Austin TV."]dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=Red Director |fix-attempted=yes  ''Broadcasting and Cable|Broadcasting'', September 4, 1972, pg. 6.</ref> and in 1980 purchased a group of stations owned by Advance Publications|Newhouse Newspapers: WAPI-TV (now WVTM-TV) in Birmingham, Alabama; KTVI in St. Louis; WSYR-TV (now WSTM-TV) in Syracuse, New York and its satellite station WSYE-TV (now WETM-TV) in Elmira, New York; and WTPA-TV (now WHTM-TV) in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/80-OCR/1980-03-31-BC-OCR-Page-0030.pdf "Times Mirror's deal for Newhouse's TVs gets FCC approval."]dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=Red Director |fix-attempted=yes  ''Broadcasting'', March 31, 1980, pg. 30.</ref>  The company also entered the field of cable television, servicing the Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix and San Diego, California|San Diego areas, amongst others. They were originally titled Times-Mirror Cable, and were later renamed to Dimension Cable Television. Similarly, they also attempted to enter the pay-TV market, with the Spotlight (TV channel)|Spotlight movie network; it wasn't successful and was quickly shut down. The cable systems were sold in the mid-1990s to Cox Communications.

Times-Mirror also pared its station group down, selling off the Syracuse, Elmira and Harrisburg properties in 1986.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/85-OCR/BC-1985-09-30-OCR-Page-0109.pdf "Changing hands: Proposed."]dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=Red Director |fix-attempted=yes  ''Broadcasting'', September 30, 1985, pg. 109.</ref> The remaining four outlets were packaged to a new upstart holding company, Argyle Television, in 1993.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/93-OCR/BC-1993-03-22-OCR-Page-0007.pdf "Times Mirror set to sell four TV'."] webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Z9oj6aQs?url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/93-OCR/BC-1993-03-22-OCR-Page-0007.pdf |date=June 9, 2015  ''Broadcasting and Cable'', March 22, 1993, pg. 7.</ref> These stations were acquired by New World Communications shortly thereafter and became key components in 1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|a sweeping shift of network-station affiliations which occurred between 1994–1995.
