''Hit Music'' was a weekly British chart newsletter; sister publication to ''Music Week''.  ''Hit Music'' existed for almost nine years, supplying the official UK music charts (as compiled by The Gallup Organization|Gallup and later The Official UK Charts Company|OCC/CIN). The founding editors were Graham Walker and Tony Brown. The first issue was published 5.09.1992 (chart date: 12.09.1992), the last issue 5.05.2001 (no. 439).

Originally it ran parallel to ''Music Week''′s other chart newsletter ''ChartsPlus'' (edited also by Graham Walker and Tony Brown), which had been established in May 1991, shortly after the demise of ''Record Mirror''. ''ChartsPlus'' featured the singles chart with positions 76 to 200, albums chart positions 76 to 150, plus several genre and format chart, details on every Top 75 new entry, radio playlists (later the E.R.A. Top 100 Airplay charts) and statistics. An annual subscription to ''ChartsPlus'' cost £495.

In September 1992, Spotlight Publications, publishers of ''Music Week'', started ''Hit Music'' as a cheaper alternative. For only £110 ''Hit Music'' printed the singles chart (Top 75+25, i.e. with compressed positions 76 to 100), artist albums (Top 100), compilation albums (Top 50), rock chart and dance chart (Top 20s), US Top 10s, plus details on Top 75 new entries, chart statistics, year-to-date charts (singles, albums, singles acts, album acts, Top 30s) listings of British Phonographic Industry|BPI awards, and number ones.

From issue no. 36 (5.06.1993) ''Hit Music'' printed the E.R.A. Top 100 Airplay charts, and from 8.01.1994 (issue no. 66) the Top 40 Network Chart (later called The Pepsi Chart).

In November 1994 ''Charts Plus'' ceased publication and from issue no. 111 (19.11.1994) Hit Music printed the (uncompressed) Top 200 Singles, Top 150 Artists Albums and Top 50 Compilations. From issue no. 211 (2.11.1996) the Artist Albums chart extended to a Top 200. Top 100 Airplay chart was dropped from issue 294 (20.06.1998).

The last issue published was no. 439 (5.05.2001). ''Hit Music'' folded together with several other ''Music Week'' newsletters.

By autumn 2001, a successor publication to ''Hit Music'' was founded, independent of ''Music Week'', in order to publish the British Top 200 charts: ''ChartsPlus'' ("Charts+Plus", not to be confused with the 1990s publication mentioned above), which is now called ''UKChartsPlus''.
