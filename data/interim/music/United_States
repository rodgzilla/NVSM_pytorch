The short form "United States" is also standard. Other common forms are the "U.S.", the "USA", and "America". Colloquial names are the "U.S. of A." and, internationally, the "States". "Columbia (name)|Columbia", a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears in the name "Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia".sfn|Brokenshire|1993|page=49

It has been generally accepted that the Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Beringia|Bering land bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago however, increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.sfn|Erlandson|Rick|Vellanoweth|2008|p=19sfn|Savage|2011|page= 55sfn|Haviland|Walrath|Prins|2013|page=219 After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward along the Pacific coastsfn|Fladmark|2017|pages= 55-69 and through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran Ice Sheet|Cordilleran and Laurentide Ice Sheet|Laurentide ice sheets.sfn|Meltzer|2009|page= 129 The Clovis culture appeared around 11,000 BC, and is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the Americas.sfn|Waters|Stafford|2007|pages=1122–1126  The Clovis culture was believed to represent the first human settlement of the Americas.sfn|Flannery|2015|pages=173–185 Over the years, more and more evidence has advanced the idea of "pre-Clovis" cultures including tools dating back about 15,550 years ago.

While estimating the original native population of North America at the time of European contact is difficult, an attempt was made in the early part of the twentieth century by James Mooney using historic records to estimate the indigenous population north of Mexico in 1600.sfn|Perdue|Green|2005|page=40sfn|Haines|Haines|Steckel|2000|page= 12 In more recent years, Douglas H.

Dobyns believed that the populations were much higher, suggestion 1,100,000 along the shores of the gulf of Mexico, 2,211,000 people living between Florida and Massachusetts, 5,250,000 in the Mississippi Valley and tributaries and 697,000 people in the Florida peninsula.sfn|Perdue|Green|2005|page=40sfn|Haines|Haines|Steckel|2000|page= 12

The first interaction between Europeans and Native Americans was made by the Norsemen. A number of surviving Norse sagas provide information regarding The Maritimes and its indigenous people.

In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.<ref>#Ripper2008|Ripper, 2008 p. 6</ref> Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans, and squash.

Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice, and wheat.

Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, the main purpose of the war from the Union's viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibited slavery.

Reconstruction (United States)|Reconstruction began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|an assassin's bullet on April 14, 1865, drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans.

The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor-saving techniques created the system called mass production.<ref>Hounshell1984</ref>

The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the NBC|National Broadcasting Company (NBC), CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television in the United States|Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.<ref>cite news |title=Streaming TV Services: What They Cost, What You Get |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/10/12/business/ap-us-streaming-tv-options.html?_r=0 |accessdate=October 12, 2015 |agency=NY Times; Associated Press |date=October 12, 2015</ref> Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.<ref>cite web |url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1004830 |title=TV Fans Spill into Web Sites |date=June 7, 2007 |publisher=eMarketer |accessdate=June 10, 2007</ref>

In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other). As of|2014|09|30|df=US, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).<ref>cite web |last=Waits |first=Jennifer |title=Number of U.S. Radio Stations on the Rise, Especially LPFM, according to New FCC Count |website=Radio Survivor |date=October 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 6, 2015 |url=http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2014/10/17/number-u-s-radio-stations-rise-especially-lpfm-according-latest-fcc-count/</ref>

Well-known newspapers include ''The Wall Street Journal'', ''The New York Times'', and ''USA Today''.<ref name="Shaffer2006">cite book |author=Brenda Shaffer |title=The Limits of Culture: Islam and Foreign Policy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEOd-cDWVwQC&pg=PA116 |year=2006 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-19529-4 |page=116</ref> Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett Company|Gannett or The McClatchy Company|McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have "alternative weeklies" to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's ''The Village Voice'' or Los Angeles' ''LA Weekly'', to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero of DC Comics, developed into an American icon.<ref>cite book |last=Daniels |first=Les |authorlink=Les Daniels |year=1998 |title=Superman: The Complete History |page=11 |edition=1st |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=978-1-85286-988-5</ref> Aside from web portals and web search engine|search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon.com|Amazon, and Twitter.<ref name="alexa-topsitesus">cite web |url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US |title=Top Sites in United States |year=2014 |publisher=Alexa |accessdate=October 20, 2014</ref>
