The UK Singles Chart (currently entitled Official Singles Chart) is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC), on behalf of the British record industry, listing the top-selling singles in the United Kingdom, based upon physical sales, paid-for downloads and music streaming|streaming. The Official Chart, broadcast on BBC Radio 1 and MTV (Official UK Top 40), is the UK music industry's recognised official measure of singles and albums popularity because it is the most comprehensive research panel of its kind, today surveying over 15,000 retailers and digital services daily, capturing 99.9% of all singles consumed in Britain across the week, and over 98% of albums.<ref>Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/getting-into-the-charts/how-the-charts-are-compiled/|title=How The Charts Are Compiled|last=Kreisler|first=Lauren|date=12 March 2018|website=OfficialCharts.com|access-date=12 March 2018</ref> To be eligible for the chart, a Single (music)|single is currently defined by the Official Charts Company (OCC) as either a 'single bundle' having no more than four tracks and not lasting longer than 25 minutes or one digital audio track not longer than 15 minutes with a minimum sale price of 40 pence.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/media/319099/official-uk-charts-singles-chart-rules-april-2013.pdf|title=Rules For Chart Eligibility: Singles|date=April 2013|publisher=Official Charts Company|location=London|page=4|format=PDF|accessdate=1 June 2015</ref> The rules have changed many times as technology has developed, the most notable being the inclusion of digital downloads in 2005 and streaming in July 2014.<ref name="streaming">cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/streaming-and-the-official-singles-chart-everything-you-need-to-know-3109/ |title=Streaming and the Official Singles Chart: Everything you need to know! |first=Daniel |last=Lane |publisher=Official Charts Company |date=23 June 2014 |accessdate=24 June 2014</ref>

The UK Singles Chart began to be compiled in 1952. According to the Official Charts Company's statistics, as of 1 July 2012, 1,200 singles have topped the UK Singles Chart.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/will.i.ams-first-solo-number-1-this-is-love-smashes-100k-sales-1467 |title=Will.I.Am's This Is Love becomes UK's 1200th Number 1 |publisher=Official Charts Company |accessdate=6 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022155808/http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/will.i.ams-first-solo-number-1-this-is-love-smashes-100k-sales-1467 |archivedate=22 October 2012 </ref> The precise number of chart-toppers is debatable due to the profusion of competing charts from the 1950s to the 1980s, but the usual list used is that endorsed by the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles and subsequently adopted by the Official Charts Company. The company regards a selected period of the ''New Musical Express'' chart (only from 1952 to 1960) and the ''Record Retailer'' chart from 1960 to 1969 as predecessors for the period prior to 11 February 1969, where multiples of competing charts (none official) coexisted side by side. For example, the BBC compiled its own chart based on an average of the music papers of the time; many songs announced as having reached number one on BBC Radio and ''Top of the Pops'' prior to 1969 are not listed as chart-toppers according to the legacy criteria of the Charts Company.

The first number one on the UK Singles Chart was "Here in My Heart" by Al Martino for the week ending date 14 November 1952. As of the week ending date 7 February 2019, the UK Singles Chart has had 1350 different number-one hits. The current number-one single is "7 Rings" by Ariana Grande.

 History

Before the compilation of sales of records, the music market measured a song's popularity by sales of sheet music. The idea of compiling a chart based on sales originated in the United States, where the music-trade paper ''Billboard (magazine)|Billboard'' compiled the first chart incorporating sales figures on 20 July 1940.

However, until 1969 the Record Retailer chart was only seen by people working in the industry. The most widely circulated chart was the NME one, as used by Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg's legendary Sunday night ''Top 20'' show, as well as by ABC TV's ''Thank Your Lucky Stars (TV series)|Thank Your Lucky Stars'', which had an audience of up to 6 million on ITV (TV network)|ITV.

Subsequently, CIN sought to develop new marketing opportunities and sponsorship deals; these included premium-rate fax and telephone services and the chart newsletters ''Charts+Plus'' (published from May 1991 to November 1994) and ''Hit Music (Newsletter)|Hit Music'' (published from September 1992 to May 2001). Beginning in May 1991 ''Charts+Plus'' featured singles charts with positions 76–200 (plus artist albums positions 76–150, Top 50 compilations, and several genre and format charts). In September 1992, a second newsletter was created: ''Hit Music'', a sister publication of ''Music Week'' featuring (among other charts) the singles Top 75 and a revived "Next 25". In November 1994, ''Charts+Plus'' ceased publication; ''Hit Music'' expanded its chart coverage to an uncompressed (without special rules) Top 200 Singles, Top 150 Artists Albums and Top 50 Compilations. In November 1996, the Artist Albums chart extended to a Top 200. ''Hit Music'' ceased publication in May 2001 with issue number 439.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.ukchartsplus.co.uk/background.htm|title=Background|work=ChartsPlus|UKChartsPlus|accessdate=11 September 2010</ref>

In February 1997, CIN and BARD agreed to a new 18-month deal for the charts.<ref>cite journal|date=20 December 1997|title=News Review of the Year &ndash; 97's menu: Spice, Ginger and Elton|journal=Music Week|issn=0265-1548</ref> In 1998 the CSC agreed to new rules reducing the number of tracks on a single from four to three, playing time from 25 minutes to 20 and the compact disc single minimum dealer price to £1.79.<ref>cite journal|first=Robert|last=Ashton|date=4 April 1998|title=CSC acts to solve "fillers" issue|journal=Music Week|issn=0265-1548</ref>
This particularly affected the dance music industry which had previously released CD's full of remixes, with some labels having to edit or fade out remixes early in order to fit them on a CD single. On 1 July 1998, BARD and BPI took over management of the chart from the CIN (a Miller Freeman and BPI venture) with new company Music Industry Chart Services (Mics);<ref>cite journal|date=1 August 1998|title=MW signs new charts deal|journal=Music Week|issn=0265-1548</ref> however, in August they decided to return to compiling the charts under the name CIN.<ref>cite journal|date=8 August 1998|title=BPI&ndash;BARD venture keeps CIN name|journal=Music Week|issn=0265-1548</ref>

In 2005, Wes Butters presented his final UK Top 40 show, concluding his tenure at Radio 1. The chart show was then rebranded for the chart week ending 16 April, and the first singles chart combining physical-release sales with legal downloads began. Several test charts (and a download-sales chart) were published in 2004; this combination (within the official singles chart) reflected a changing era in which sales of physical singles fell and download sales rose. On 17 April 2005, hosts JK and Joel commented during their BBC Radio 1 broadcast that the incorporation of download sales resulted in an approximate doubling of singles sales for the week. For the first week's combined chart the impact of this doubling was not readily apparent at the top of the chart, although a few singles in the middle positions benefited.

Initially, the British Association of Record Dealers was concerned that the popularity of downloading would siphon business from the High Street.Citation needed|date=June 2007 It also complained that including singles not available physically would confuse customers and create gaps in stores' sale racks. However, it agreed to the new rules provided that digital sales were only included to a single's sales tally if there was a physical equivalent sold in shops at the time. Since there was no rule governing a minimum number of pressings, Gorillaz released only 300 vinyl copies of their single "Feel Good Inc." on 12 April 2005 (a month before its general release). This allowed it to debut in the chart at number 22 (eventually reaching number 2), and remain in the Top 40 for a longer period.

After pressure from elsewhere in the music industry a second compromise was reached in 2006, which now allowed singles to chart on downloads the week before their physical release. The first song to make the Top 40 on downloads alone was "Pump It" by The Black Eyed Peas, which charted at number 16 on 12 March 2006. Three weeks later, "Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy" by Gnarls Barkley became the first song to top the charts on download sales alone. As part of the revised rules, singles would now be removed from the chart two weeks after the deletion of their physical formats; "Crazy" left the chart 11 weeks later from number 5 and a subsequent chart-topper, Nelly Furtado's "Maneater (Nelly Furtado song)|Maneater", disappeared from number 10. This was in addition to the existing rule that to be eligible for the chart, the physical single had to have been released within the last twelve months, supporting the general view that the chart reflected the top-selling "current" releases.

Over the coming months digital sales continued to increase whilst physical sales continued to fall; more artists entered the top 40 early, and fewer singles entered the chart directly at number 1. Whilst initially the proportion of digital sales to physical sales in the combined tally was relatively low, a majority of singles by 2012 saw more than 50 percent of their sales coming from online. Sales through mobile phones are also counted.Citation needed|date=February 2010

On 1 January 2007 the integration of downloaded music into the charts became complete when all downloads – with or without a physical equivalent – became eligible to chart, redefining the UK singles chart by turning it into a "songs" chart. This saw a few singles gain publicity: "Crazy" and "Maneater" (still selling strongly on downloads some time after their physical equivalents had been withdrawn) returned to the chart with several others which had been removed in the preceding months. "Chasing Cars" by Snow Patrol returned at a Top 10 position (number 9, just three places below the peak it had reached the previous September), while "Honey to the Bee" by Billie Piper (following a tongue-in-cheek promotional push by BBC Radio 1|Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles to test the new chart rules) reappeared at number 17 (nearly eight years after its original appearance on the charts).

The second song to return to the Top 40 several years after its first hit run was "I'll Be Missing You" by Puff Daddy and Faith Evans, which reappeared at number 32 a decade after it originally topped the chart. The impetus this time was Puff Daddy's recent performance of a new version of the track at the Concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium. Two months later Luciano Pavarotti's "Nessun Dorma" returned to the chart at number 24 during the week following his death (17 years after it was first a hit), climbing to number 12. A drumming gorilla in a Dairy Milk television advertisement helped "In the Air Tonight" by Phil Collins to climb to number 14, 26 years after it was first a hit and 19 years since its last chart appearance as a remix. None of these songs had been officially re-issued.

"Blag, Steal and Borrow (song)|Blag, Steal and Borrow" by Koopa (band)|Koopa became the first song to chart without being released physically (and the first by an unsigned band to do so). Later they would do it again twice, with "One Off Song for the Summer" and "The Crash" reaching No. 21 and No. 16 respectively (while the band remained unsigned until the following year).

Following the cancellation of its physical release, "Say It Right" by Nelly Furtado was the first Top 10 hit to pass through its chart career without a single copy appearing in a shop. "Lord Don't Slow Me Down (song)|Lord Don't Slow Me Down" by Oasis (band)|Oasis became the second, "Violet Hill (song)|Violet Hill" by Coldplay the third, and "Disturbia (song)|Disturbia" by Rihanna the fourth; "Candyman (Christina Aguilera song)|Candyman" by Christina Aguilera had a chart run that took it into the Top 20 (number 17) entirely on downloads.

The first number-one hit never released physically was "Run (Snow Patrol song)#Leona Lewis version|Run" by Leona Lewis, the 11th song in total to reach number one on downloads alone. Unlike the previous 10, it did not receive a physical release in subsequent weeks (although it was released physically overseas, notably in Germany).

The second occurrence was on 20 December 2009, when "Killing in the Name" by Rage Against the Machine became the first song that was not a new release to reach No. 1 on downloads alone. This was the result of a Facebook campaign urging people to download the song in a bid to prevent ''The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor'' winning song from becoming the Christmas No. 1 single again after four consecutive years. The song originally peaked at No. 25 in 1992.<ref>cite news|title=Rage Against The Machine Vs 'X Factor' campaign founder: 'Fuck me I can't believe it's Number One'|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/rage-against-the-machine-11-1300814|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=NME|date=20 December 2009</ref>

New rules were added to the chart on 16 September 2007 to include one-track CD singles (with a limit of 15 minutes) and to retail at a minimum of 40p per one-track CD single.

A notable effect of the new chart rules is to demonstrate the enduring appeal of many downloads, especially if a physical copy is no longer (or never has been) available. Despite a seven-week gap in its chart run in late 2006 while ineligible under the old rules, Snow Patrol's "Chasing Cars" clocked 108 weeks on the chart, a record bettered by only one single in chart history ("My Way (song)|My Way" by Frank Sinatra with 124 weeks). Numerous other hits are on for more than 40 weeks.

Jeff Buckley's 1994 cover of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah" charted at number 2 on 21 December 2008 on downloads alone, following the formation of a 110,000-strong protest group on Facebook to get it above (winner of ''The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor'' 2008) Alexandra Burke's version for the Christmas number one.

Another consequence of the chart rules is that in the event of a new album release by a well-known artist, all (or most) of its tracks could appear on the singles chart due to buyers downloading individual songs rather than the complete album. There was no significant example of this until early October 2007, with the cast of ''High School Musical 2'' placing six of its songs in the Top 75 (although these were credited to their individual performers) and a further four just outside. A month later, Leona Lewis placed five tracks from her album ''Spirit (Leona Lewis album)|Spirit'' simultaneously on the singles chart. Another example was anticipated with the arrival of The Beatles' catalogue online, with forecasters predicting the entire top 10 being taken up by Beatles songs.<ref>cite news|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/104367/beatles-albums-remastered-for-download-debut.html|title=Beatles albums remastered for download debut|date=13 February 2007|website=PC Pro|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919001320/http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/104367/beatles-albums-remastered-for-download-debut.html |archive-date=19 September 2007 </ref><ref>cite web|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/mp3/news/2007/04/13/Beatles-To-Dominate-Charts-As-EMI-Lawsuit-Settled/p1 |title=Beatles To Dominate Charts As EMI Lawsuit Settled |publisher=TrustedReviews |accessdate=5 December 2012</ref> This chart domination never occurred; only four Beatles songs re-entered the Top 75, the highest-placed being "Let It Be (song)|Let It Be" at number 38.

Yet another effect of the new rules was the reappearance in the chart of a number of seasonal favourites during Christmas 2007. A total of 19 achieved this without being officially re-issued (on downloads alone). Two of these (by Mariah Carey and The Pogues), reached the Top 5. Eleven Christmas hits returned to the Top 75 for Christmas 2008, nine in 2009, eight in 2010 and twelve in 2011, with the Mariah Carey and Pogues songs faring best each year.

The first unsigned artist to break the top 5 was Alex Day, who reached number 4 with his single "Forever Yours" in the Christmas chart, beating Coldplay and Olly Murs,<ref>cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/2011-12-31/ |title=2011-12-31 Top 40 Official UK Singles Archive |publisher=Official Charts |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=5 December 2012</ref> following a large-scale social media campaign. In February 2013, unsigned artists Macklemore and Ryan Lewis topped the chart with "Thrift Shop".<ref>cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/thrift-shop-checks-out-at-number-1-1849/ |title=Thrift Shop checks out at Number 1  |work=UK Singles Chart |publisher=Official Charts Company |accessdate=24 July 2013</ref>

The death of Michael Jackson on 25 June 2009 triggered a surge in sales of his recordings; this was the first time in the download era that the effect of a major star's death on the chart could be observed. During the week beginning 28 June, a total of 16 of his solo hits (plus four more by The Jackson 5) re-entered the chart. The following week, the momentum continued; 27 Jackson titles charted in the Top 75 (21 solo, one with his sister Janet Jackson|Janet and five by The Jacksons) with "Man in the Mirror" charting the highest, at number 2. The second chart invasion of the download era resulting from the death of a major artist was observed in late July 2011 following the death of Amy Winehouse, with seven former singles charting and one other song appearing for the first time.

It was announced in June 2014 that as of Sunday, 29 June, audio streams from services such as Spotify, Deezer, Napster, O2 Tracks, Xbox Music, Sony Unlimited and Rara.com|rara would be counted towards the Official Singles Chart, in order to reflect changing music consumption in the United Kingdom.<ref>cite news|last1=Kreisler|first1=Lauren|title=UK's Official Singles Chart to include streaming data for first time|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/uks-official-singles-chart-to-include-streaming-data-for-first-time-3105/|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=OfficialCharts.com|date=22 June 2014</ref> The final number one on the UK Singles Chart to be based on sales alone was "Gecko (Overdrive)" by Oliver Heldens featuring Becky Hill.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/oliver-heldens-and-becky-hill-knock-ella-henderson-off-number-1-3124/|title=Oliver Heldens and Becky Hill knock Ella Henderson off Number 1|work=officialcharts.com</ref> On Sunday 6 July 2014, the Official Charts Company announced that Ariana Grande had earned a place in UK chart history when her single "Problem (Ariana Grande song)|Problem" featuring Iggy Azalea became the first number-one single based on sales and streaming data.<ref>cite news|last1=Lane|first1=Daniel|title=Ariana Grande earns a place in Official Chart history with Problem|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/ariana-grande-earns-a-place-in-official-chart-history-with-problem-3146/|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=Official Charts Company|date=6 July 2014</ref>

Main|List of UK charts and number-one singles (1952–1969)

With no official chart before 1969, a number of periodicals compiled their own charts during the 1950s and 1960s. The five main charts (as used by BBC's ''Pick of the Pops'') were:

*NME|''New Musical Express'' (''NME'') (1952&ndash;1988): The first singles chart, a major source until March 1960, widely followed throughout the 1960s
*''Record Mirror'' (1955&ndash;1962): The second singles chart; compiled the first album chart, published ''Record Retailer'' chart from 1962. The ''Pick of the Pops'' average stopped using ''Record Mirror'' after 21 May 1960, due to the paper changing its weekly publication day
*''Melody Maker'' (1956&ndash;1988): The third singles chart, major source for album charts from 1958 onwards
*Disc (magazine)|''Disc'' (1958&ndash;1967): The fourth singles chart
*''Record Retailer'' (1960&ndash;1969): The fifth singles chart; a trade paper, regarded as a major source from its inception; jointly formed BMRB chart in 1969. Not included in the ''Pick of the Pops'' average until 31 March 1962.

=Midweek chart updates=
From March 2010 Greg James hosted a half-hour show at 3:30 pm on Wednesdays, announcing a chart update based on midweek sales figures previously only available to the industry. The chairman of the Official Charts Company said it would provide "insight into how the race for number one is shaping up".<ref>cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/10056409|title=Official midweek 'chart update' launched|work=Newsbeat|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 November 2010</ref> Scott Mills became the host of the Chart Update from April 2012, due to schedule changes which saw Mills host what was Greg's early afternoon show.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-02-28/scott-mills-loses-drive-time-slot-to-greg-james-in-radio-1-shake-up|title=Scott Mills Loses Drive Time Slot to Greg James|work=Radio Times|accessdate=8 March 2016</ref>  When the chart moved to Fridays in July 2015, the chart update moved to 5:30 pm on Mondays.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-chart-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-week-ahead__9971/|title=The Official Chart: Everything you need to know about the week ahead|date=4 July 2015|first=Martin|last=Talbot|accessdate=4 July 2015</ref> The show was then once again hosted by Greg James and the top ten songs are quickly overviewed with the top three being played in full before Newsbeat at 5:45. It is currently presented by Nick Grimshaw due to his swap of times with Greg James.

Sponsorship
In 1999, the chart was sponsored by worldpop.com with the company receiving name recognition during the BBC programme. However, the deal ended when the website went out of business in late 2001. As part of an agreement with ''Billboard (magazine)|Billboard'' to publish the UK chart in section of their magazine, ''Billboard'' required the chart to have a sponsor. In 2003, it was announced that Coca-Cola had signed a two-year contract with the Official Charts Company beginning 1 January 2004. Although the amount was not publicly disclosed, it was believed to be between Pound sterling|£1.5&nbsp;million and £2&nbsp;million. Since advertising on the BBC is prohibited under the BBC Charter and the government was attempting to reduce childhood obesity, the decision was widely criticised. Coca-Cola was restricted to two on-air mentions during the chart show, with the BBC justifying the deal by saying it did not negotiate or benefit financially.<ref>cite journal|last=Legrand|first=Emmanuel|date=13 December 2003|title=Coke Deal is Real Thing for U.K. Music Charts|journal=Billboard (magazine)|Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|volume=115|issue=50|pages=9, 62|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref> A few days into the contract, the BBC agreed to drop on-air mentions of the brand.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=6029&sectioncode=1|title=BBC to pull chart sponsor credits|date=2 January 2004|work=Music Week|accessdate=19 November 2010</ref>
