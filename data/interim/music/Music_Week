''Music Week'' is a trade paper for the UK record industry. It is published by Future plc|Future.

 History 

Founded in 1959 as ''Record Retailer'', it relaunched on 18 March 1972 as ''Music Week''. On 17 January 1981, the title again changed, owing to the increasing importance of sell-through videos, to ''Music & Video Week''. The rival ''Record Business'', founded in 1978 by Brian Mulligan and Norman Garrod, was absorbed into Music Week in February 1983. Later that year, the offshoot ''Video Week'' launched and the title of the parent publication reverted to ''Music Week''.

Since April 1991, ''Music Week'' has incorporated ''Record Mirror'', initially as a 4 or 8-page chart supplement, later as a dance supplement of articles, reviews and charts. In the 1990s, several magazines and newsletters become part of the Music Week family: ''Music Business International (MBI)'', ''Promo'', ''MIRO Future Hits'', ''Tours Report'', ''Fono'', ''Green Sheet'', ''Charts+Plus'' (published from May 1991 to November 1994), and ''Hit Music'' (September 1992 to May 2001). By May 2001, all newsletters (except ''Promo'') closed.

In 2003, ''Music Week'' relaunched its website of daily news, features, record release listings and UK sales, airplay and club charts. In early 2006, a separate free-to-access site for the ''Music Week Directory'' listed 10,000 contacts in the UK music industry. In mid-2007, the magazine was redesigned by London company This Is Real Art. In October 2008, another redesign led to major changes.

In June 2011, ''Music Week'' was sold to Intent Media.<ref name="IntentPR11">cite web|title=Intent Media acquires UBM titles for £2.4m|accessdate=29 July 2011 |date=27 June 2011|work= Intent Media |url=http://www.intentmedia.co.uk/release.php?id=128</ref><ref name="MWSOLD1">cite web|title=UBM sells Music Week|accessdate=27 June 2011|date=27 June 2011|publisher=thecmuwebsite|url=http://www.thecmuwebsite.com/article/ubm-sells-music-week/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701114217/http://www.thecmuwebsite.com/article/ubm-sells-music-week/|archive-date=1 July 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all</ref><ref name="MWSOLD2">cite web|title=Intent Media acquires Music Week|accessdate=27 June 2011|date=27 June 2011|work=Music Week|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=1045708&c=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830035447/http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=1045708&c=1|archive-date=30 August 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all</ref>
