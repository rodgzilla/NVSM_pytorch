History of France
The first written records for the history of France appeared in the Iron Age France|Iron Age. What is now France made up the bulk of the region known to the Romans as Gaul. Roman writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in the area: the Gauls, the Aquitani, and the Belgae. The Gauls, the largest and best attested group, were Celts|Celtic people speaking what is known as the Gaulish language.

Over the course of the 1st millennium BC the Greeks, Romans and Carthage|Carthaginians established colonies on the Mediterranean coast and the offshore islands. The Roman Republic annexed southern Gaul as the Roman province|province of Gallia Narbonensis in the late 2nd century BC, and Roman forces under Julius Caesar conquered the rest of Gaul in the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC. Afterwards a Gallo-Roman culture emerged and Gaul was increasingly integrated into the Roman Empire.

In the later stages of the Roman Empire, Gaul was subject to barbarian raids and migration, most importantly by the Germanic peoples|Germanic Franks. The Frankish king Clovis I united most of Gaul under his rule in the late 5th century, setting the stage for Frankish dominance in the region for hundreds of years. Frankish power reached its fullest extent under Charlemagne. The medieval Kingdom of France emerged from the western part of Charlemagne's Carolingian Empire, known as West Francia, and achieved increasing prominence under the rule of the House of Capet, founded by Hugh Capet in 987.

A Order of succession|succession crisis following the death of the last direct Capetian monarch in 1328 led to the series of conflicts known as the Hundred Years' War between the House of Valois and the House of Plantagenet. The war formally began in 1337 following Philip VI of France|Philip VI's attempt to seize the Duchy of Aquitaine from its hereditary holder, Edward III of England, the Plantagenet claimant to the French throne.  Despite early Plantagenet victories, including the capture and ransom of John II of France, fortunes turned in favor of the Valois later in the war.  Among the notable figures of the war was Joan of Arc, a French peasant girl who led French forces against the English, establishing herself as a national heroine.  The war ended with a Valois victory in 1453.

Victory in the Hundred Years' War had the effect of strengthening French nationalism and vastly increasing the power and reach of the French monarchy. During the period known as the ''Ancien Régime'', France transformed into a centralized absolute monarchy.  During the next centuries, France experienced the French Renaissance|Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation.  At the height of the French Wars of Religion, France became embroiled in another succession crisis, as the last Valois king, Henry III of France|Henry III, fought against rival factions the House of Bourbon and the House of Guise. Henry IV of France|Henry, King of Navarre, scion of the Bourbon family, would be victorious in the conflict and establish the French Bourbon dynasty.  A burgeoning worldwide French colonial empire|colonial empire was established in the 16th century.  French political power reached a zenith under the rule of Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV, "The Sun King", builder of Palace of Versailles|Versailles Palace.

In the late 18th century the monarchy and associated institutions were overthrown in the French Revolution.  The country was governed for a period as a French First Republic|Republic, until the First French Empire|French Empire was declared by Napoleon Bonaparte. Following Napoleon's defeat in the Napoleonic Wars, France went through several further regime changes, being ruled as a Bourbon Restoration|monarchy, then briefly as a French Second Republic|Second Republic, and then as a Second French Empire|Second Empire, until a more lasting French Third Republic was established in 1870.

France was one of the Triple Entente powers in World War I, fighting alongside the United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, Japan, the United States and Allies of World War I|smaller allies against Germany and the Central Powers.

France was one of the Allies of World War II|Allied Powers in World War II, but was conquered by Nazi Germany in 1940. The Third Republic was dismantled, and most of the country was controlled directly by Germany while the south was controlled until 1942 by the collaborationist Vichy France|Vichy government.  Living conditions were harsh as Germany drained away food and manpower, and many Jews were killed. Charles de Gaulle led the Free France movement that one-by-one took over the colonial empire, and coordinated the wartime French Resistance|Resistance.  Following liberation of France|liberation in summer 1944, a French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic was established. France slowly recovered economically, and enjoyed a baby boom that reversed its very low fertility rate.  Long wars in Indochina and Algeria drained French resources and ended in political defeat. In the wake of the May 1958 crisis|Algerian Crisis  of 1958, Charles de Gaulle set up the French Fifth Republic. Into the 1960s decolonization saw most of the French colonial empire become independent, while smaller parts were incorporated into the French state as overseas departments and overseas collectivities|collectivities. Since World War II France has been a permanent member in the UN Security Council and NATO.  It played a central role in the unification process after 1945 that led to the European Union. Despite slow economic growth in recent years, it remains a Great Power|strong economic, cultural, military and political factor in the 21st century.

Main|Gaul 
Covering large parts of modern-day France, Belgium, northwest Germany and northern Italy, Gaul was inhabited by many Celts|Celtic and Belgae tribes whom the Romans referred to as Gauls and who spoke the Gaulish language roughly between the Oise (river)|Oise and the Garonne (''Gallia Celtica''), according to Julius Caesar.citation needed|date=June 2015 On the lower Garonne the people spoke Aquitanian language|Aquitanian, a Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European language related to (or a direct ancestor of) Basque language|Basque whereas a Belgian language was spoken north of Lutecia but north of the Loire according to other authors like Strabo. The Celts founded cities such as Lutetia|Lutetia Parisiorum (Paris) and Bordeaux|Burdigala (Bordeaux) while the Aquitanians founded Toulouse|Tolosa (Toulouse).citation needed|date=June 2015

Long before any Roman settlements, Greek navigators settled in what would become Provence.<ref>cite web|last1=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Provence|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Provence-region-France|website=www.britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=19 January 2017</ref> The Phocaea|Phoceans founded important cities such as Marseille|Massalia (Marseille) and Nice|Nikaia (Nice), bringing them into conflict with the neighboring Celts and Ligurians. Some Phocean great navigators, such as Pytheas, were born in Marseille. The Celts themselves often fought with Aquitanians and Germans, and a Gaulish war band led by Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus invaded Rome c. 393 or 388 BC following the Battle of the Allia.citation needed|date=June 2015

However, the tribal society of the Gauls did not change fast enough for the centralized Roman state, who would learn to counter them.The Gaulish tribal confederacies were then defeated by the Romans in battles such as Battle of Sentinum|Sentinum and Battle of Telamon|Telamon during the 3rd century BC.citation needed|date=June 2015 In the early 3rd century BC, some Belgae (Germani cisrhenani) conquered the surrounding territories of the river Somme|Somme in northern Gaul after battles supposedly against the Armoricani (Gauls) near Ribemont-sur-Ancre and Gournay-sur-Aronde, where sanctuaries were found.citation needed|date=June 2015

When Carthaginian Republic|Carthaginian commander Hannibal|Hannibal Barca fought the Romans, he recruited several Gaulish mercenaries who fought on his side at Battle of Cannae|Cannae. It was this Gaulish participation that caused Provence to be annexed in 122 BC by the Roman Republic.Citation needed|date=December 2008 Later, the Consul of Gaul — Julius Caesar — conquered all of Gaul. Despite Gaulish opposition led by Vercingetorix, the Gauls succumbed to the Roman onslaught. The Gauls had some success at first at Battle of Gergovia|Gergovia, but were ultimately defeated at Battle of Alesia|Alesia in 52 BC.

Gaul was divided into several different provinces. The Romans displaced populations to prevent local identities from becoming a threat to Roman control. Thus, many Celts were displaced in Gallia Aquitania|Aquitania or were enslaved and moved out of Gaul. There was a strong cultural evolution in Gaul under the Roman Empire, the most obvious one being the replacement of the Gaulish language by Vulgar Latin. It has been argued the similarities between the Gaulish and Latin languages favoured the transition. Gaul remained under Roman control for centuries and Celtic culture was then gradually replaced by Gallo-Roman culture.

The Gauls became better integrated with the Empire with the passage of time. For instance, generals Marcus Antonius Primus and Gnaeus Julius Agricola were both born in Gaul, as were emperors Claudius and Caracalla. Emperor Antoninus Pius also came from a Gaulish family. In the decade following Valerian (emperor)|Valerian's capture by the Persians in 260, Postumus established a short-lived Gallic Empire, which included the Iberian Peninsula and Britannia, in addition to Gaul itself. Germanic tribes, the Franks and the Alamanni, entered Gaul at this time. The Gallic Empire ended with Emperor Aurelian's victory at Battle of Châlons (274)|Châlons in 274.

A migration of Celts appeared in the 4th century in Armorica. They were led by the legendary king Conan Meriadoc and came from Britain. They spoke the now extinct British language (Celtic)|British language, which evolved into the Breton language|Breton, Cornish language|Cornish, and Welsh languages.

In 418 the Aquitanian province was given to the Goths in exchange for their support against the Vandals. Those same Goths had sacked Rome in 410 and established a capital in Toulouse.

The Roman Empire had difficulty responding to all the barbarian raids, and Flavius Aëtius had to use these tribes against each other in order to maintain some Roman control.
He first used the Huns against the Burgundians, and these mercenaries destroyed Worms, Germany|Worms, killed king Gunther, and pushed the Burgundians westward. The Burgundians were resettled by Aëtius near Lugdunum in 443. The Huns, united by Attila the Hun|Attila, became a greater threat, and Aëtius used the Visigoths against the Huns. The conflict climaxed in 451 at the Battle of Châlons, in which the Romans and Goths defeated Attila.

The Roman Empire was on the verge of collapsing. Aquitania was definitely abandoned to the Visigoths, who would soon conquer a significant part of southern Gaul as well as most of the Iberian Peninsula. The Burgundians claimed their own kingdom, and northern Gaul was practically abandoned to the Franks. Aside from the Germanic peoples, the Vascones entered Duchy of Vasconia|Wasconia from the Pyrenees and the Bretons formed three kingdoms in Armorica: Domnonia, Cornouaille and Broërec.<ref>P. J.

File:Steuben - Bataille de Poitiers.png|thumb|Victory over the Muslims at the Battle of Tours (732) marked the furthest Muslim advance and enabled Frankish domination of Europe for the next century.
In 486, Clovis I, leader of the Salian Franks, defeated Syagrius at Battle of Soissons (486)|Soissons and subsequently united most of northern and central Gaul under his rule. Clovis then recorded a succession of victories against other Germanic tribes such as the Alamanni at Battle of Tolbiac|Tolbiac. In 496, pagan Clovis adopted Catholicism. This gave him greater legitimacy and power over his Christian subjects and granted him clerical support against the Arian Visigoths. He defeated Alaric II at Battle of Vouillé|Vouillé in 507 and annexed Aquitaine, and thus Toulouse, into his Frankish kingdom.<ref name=autogenerated3>Edward James, ''The Franks'' (1991)</ref>

The Goths retired to Toledo, Spain|Toledo in what would become Spain. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian Dynasty but his kingdom would not survive his death in 511. Under Frankish inheritance traditions, all sons inherit part of the land, so four kingdoms emerged: centered on Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims.  Over time, the borders and numbers of Frankish kingdoms were fluid and changed frequently.  Also during this time, the Mayor of the Palace|Mayors of the Palace, originally the chief advisor to the kings, would become the real power in the Frankish lands; the Merovingian kings themselves would be reduced to little more than figureheads.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

By this time Muslim invaders had Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered Hispania and were threatening the Frankish kingdoms. Duke Odo the Great defeated a major invading force at Battle of Toulouse (721)|Toulouse in 721 but failed to repel a raiding party in 732. The mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated that raiding party at the Battle of Tours and earned respect and power within the Frankish Kingdom. The assumption of the crown in 751 by Pepin the Short (son of Charles Martel) established the Carolingian dynasty as the Kings of the Franks.

File:Sacre de Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|The coronation of Charlemagne
Carolingian power reached its fullest extent under Pepin's son, Charlemagne. In 771, Charlemagne reunited the Frankish domains after a further period of division, subsequently conquering the Lombards under Desiderius in what is now northern Italy (774), incorporating History of Bavaria#Bavaria and the Agilolfings under Frankish overlordship|Bavaria (788) into his realm, defeating the Avars (Carpathians)|Avars of the Danube|Danubian plain (796), advancing the frontier with Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain as far south as Barcelona (801), and subjugating Lower Saxony after a prolonged campaign (804).

In recognition of his successes and his political support for the Papacy, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans, or Roman Emperor in the West, by Pope Leo III in 800. Charlemagne's son Louis the Pious (emperor 814–840) kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive Louis I's death. Two of his sons – Charles the Bald and Louis the German – swore allegiance to each other against their brother – Lothair I – in the Oaths of Strasbourg, and the empire was divided among Louis's three sons (Treaty of Verdun, 843). After a last brief reunification (884–887), the imperial title ceased to be held in the western realm, which was to form the basis of the future French kingdom. The eastern realm, which would become Germany, elected the Saxon dynasty of Henry the Fowler.<ref>Derek Wilson, ''Charlemagne'' (2007)</ref>

Under the Carolingians, the kingdom was ravaged by Siege of Paris (885-886)|Viking raiders. In this struggle some important figures such as Odo, Count of Paris|Count Odo of Paris and his brother Robert I of France|King Robert rose to fame and became kings. This emerging dynasty, whose members were called the Robertian dynasty|Robertines, were the predecessors of the Capetian Dynasty. Led by Rollo of Normandy|Rollo, some Vikings had settled in Normandy and were granted the land, first as counts and then as dukes, by King Charles the Simple, in order to protect the land from other raiders.

=Strong princes=
France was a very decentralised state during the Middle Ages. The authority of the king was more religious than administrative. The 11th century in France marked the apogee of princely power at the expense of the king when states like Normandy, Flanders or Languedoc enjoyed a local authority comparable to kingdoms in all but name. The House of Capet|Capetians, as they were descended from the Robertians, were formerly powerful princes themselves who had successfully unseated the weak and unfortunate Carolingian kings.<ref name="autogenerated1993">Georges Duby, ''France in the Middle Ages 987–1460: From Hugh Capet to Joan of Arc'' (1993),</ref>

The Carolingian kings had nothing more than a royal title when the House of Capet|Capetian kings added their principality to that title. The Capetians, in a way, held a dual status of King and Prince; as king they held the Crown of Charlemagne and as Count of Paris they held their personal fiefdom, best known as Île-de-France.<ref name="autogenerated1993"/>

The fact that the Capetians held lands as both Prince and King gave them a complicated status. They were involved in the struggle for power within France as princes, but they also had a religious authority over Roman Catholicism in France as King. The Capetian kings treated other princes more as enemies and allies than as subordinates: their royal title was recognised yet frequently disrespected. Capetian authority was so weak in some remote places that bandits were the effective power.<ref name="autogenerated1993"/>

Some of the king's vassals would grow sufficiently powerful that they would become some of the strongest rulers of western Europe. The Normans, the Plantagenets, the Lusignans, the Hautevilles, the Ramnulfids, and the House of Counts of Toulouse|Toulouse successfully carved lands outside France for themselves. The most important of these conquests for French history was the Norman Conquest of England by William I of England|William the Conqueror, following the Battle of Hastings and immortalised in the Bayeux Tapestry, because it linked England to France through Normandy. Although the Normans were now both vassals of the French kings and their equals as kings of England, their zone of political activity remained centered in France.<ref>David Carpenter ''The Struggle for Mastery. The Penguin history of Britain 1066–1284'' p. 91: "In the first place, after 1072 William was largely an absentee. Of the 170 months remaining of his reign he spent around 130 in France, returning to England only on four occasions. This was no passing phase. Absentee kings continued to spend at best half their time in England until the loss of Normandy in 1204... But this absenteeism solidified rather than sapped royal government since it engendered structures both to maintain peace and extract money on the king's absence, money which was above all needed across the channel".</ref>

An important part of the French aristocracy also involved itself in the crusades, and French knights founded and ruled the Crusader states. An example of the legacy left in the Middle East by these nobles is the Krak des Chevaliers' enlargement by the Counts of Tripoli and Toulouse.

=Rise of the monarchy=
The monarchy overcame the powerful barons over ensuing centuries, and established absolute sovereignty over France in the 16th century. A number of factors contributed to the rise of the French monarchy. The dynasty established by Hugh Capet continued uninterrupted until 1328, and the laws of primogeniture ensured orderly successions of power. Secondly, the successors of Capet came to be recognised as members of an illustrious and ancient royal house and therefore socially superior to their politically and economically superior rivals. Thirdly, the Capetians had the support of the Papacy, history|Church, which favoured a strong central government in France. This alliance with the Church was one of the great enduring legacies of the Capetians. The First Crusade was composed almost entirely of Frankish Princes. As time went on the power of the King was expanded by conquests, seizures and successful feudal political battles.<ref name="google235"/>

The history of France starts with the election of Hugh Capet (940–996) by an assembly summoned in Reims in 987. Capet had been "Duke of the Franks" and then became "King of the Franks" (Rex Francorum). Hugh's lands extended little beyond the Paris basin; his political unimportance weighed against the powerful barons who elected him. Many of the king's vassals (who included for a long time the kings of England) ruled over territories far greater than his own.<ref name="google235">cite book|author1=Marvin Perry|author2=and others|author3=Margaret Jacob|title=Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society: To 1789|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XMKpq_nV0J8C&pg=PA235|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=235|displayauthors=1|isbn=978-0547147420</ref> He was recorded to be recognised king by the Gauls, Bretons, Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes, Aquitanians, Goths, Spanish and Gascons.<ref name="autogenerated1995">William W.

Hugh's son—Robert II of France|Robert the Pious—was crowned King of the Franks before Capet's demise. Hugh Capet decided so in order to have his succession secured. Robert II, as King of the Franks, met Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II in 1023 on the borderline. They agreed to end all claims over each other's realm, setting a new stage of Capetian and Ottonian relationships. Although a king weak in power, Robert II's efforts were considerable. His surviving charters imply he relied heavily on the Church to rule France, much like his father did. Although he lived with a mistress—Bertha of Burgundy—and was excommunicated because of this, he was regarded as a model of piety for monks (hence his nickname, Robert the Pious).<ref name="autogenerated1995"/>  The reign of Robert II was quite important because it involved the Peace and Truce of God (beginning in 989) and the Cluniac Reforms.<ref name="autogenerated1995"/>

Under Philip I of France|King Philip I, the kingdom enjoyed a modest recovery during his extraordinarily long reign (1060–1108). His reign also saw the launch of the First Crusade to regain the Holy Land, which heavily involved his family although he personally did not support the expedition.

It is from Louis VI of France|Louis VI (reigned 1108–37) onward that royal authority became more accepted. Louis VI was more a soldier and warmongering king than a scholar. The way the king raised money from his vassals made him quite unpopular; he was described as greedy and ambitious and that is corroborated by records of the time. His regular attacks on his vassals, although damaging the royal image, reinforced the royal power. From 1127 onward Louis had the assistance of a skilled religious statesman, Abbot Suger. The abbot was the son of a minor family of knights, but his political advice was extremely valuable to the king. Louis VI successfully defeated, both military and politically, many of the Robber baron (feudalism)|robber barons. Louis VI frequently summoned his vassals to the court, and those who did not show up often had their land possessions confiscated and military campaigns mounted against them. This drastic policy clearly imposed some royal authority on Paris and its surrounding areas. When Louis VI died in 1137, much progress had been made towards strengthening Capetian authority.<ref name="autogenerated1995"/>

Thanks to Abbot Suger's political advice, Louis VII of France|King Louis VII (junior king 1131–37, senior king 1137–80) enjoyed greater moral authority over France than his predecessors. Powerful vassals paid homage to the French king.<ref>Capetian France 937–1328 p. 64: "Then, in 1151, Henry Plantagenet paid homage for the duchy to Louis VII in Paris, homage he repeated as king of England in 1156."</ref>  Abbot Suger arranged the 1137 marriage between Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine in Bordeaux, which made Louis VII Duke of Aquitaine and gave him considerable power. However, the couple disagreed over the burning of more than a thousand people in Vitry-en-Perthois|Vitry during the conflict against the Count of Champagne.<ref name=autogenerated4>Paul Frankl, ''Gothic Architecture'' (2001)</ref>

King Louis VII was deeply horrified by the event and sought penitence by going to the Holy Land. He later involved the Kingdom of France in the Second Crusade but his relationship with Eleanor did not improve. The marriage was ultimately annulled by the pope and Eleanor soon married the Duke of Normandy – Henry II of England|Henry Fitzempress, who would become King of England as Henry II two years later.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> Louis VII was once a very powerful monarch and was now facing a much stronger vassal, who was his equal as King of England and his strongest prince as Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine.

=Late Capetians (1165–1328)=
The late direct Capetian kings were considerably more powerful and influential than the earliest ones. While Philip I could hardly control his Parisian barons, Philip IV could dictate popes and emperors. The late Capetians, although they often ruled for a shorter time than their earlier peers, were often much more influential. This period also saw the rise of a complex system of international alliances and conflicts opposing, through dynasties, Kings of France and England and Holy Roman Emperor.

Philip II Augustus
The reign of Philip II of France|Philip II Augustus (junior king 1179–80, senior king 1180–1223) marked an important step in the history of French monarchy. His reign saw the French royal domain and influence greatly expanded. He set the context for the rise of power to much more powerful monarchs like Saint Louis and Philip the Fair.

File:Bataille de Bouvines gagnee par Philippe Auguste.jpg|300px|thumb|Philip II of France|Philip II victorious at Bouvines thus annexing Normandy and Anjou into his royal domains. This battle involved a complex set of alliances from three important states, the Kingdoms of France and England and the Holy Roman Empire.
Philip II spent an important part of his reign fighting the so-called Angevin Empire, which was probably the greatest threat to the King of France since the rise of the Capetian dynasty. During the first part of his reign Philip II tried using Henry II of England's son against him. He allied himself with the Duke of Aquitaine and son of Henry II—Richard I of England|Richard Lionheart—and together they launched a decisive attack on Henry's castle and home of Chinon and removed him from power.

Richard replaced his father as King of England afterward. The two kings then went crusading during the Third Crusade; however, their alliance and friendship broke down during the crusade. The two men were once again at odds and fought each other in France until Richard was on the verge of totally defeating Philip II.

Adding to their battles in France, the Kings of France and England were trying to install their respective allies at the head of the Holy Roman Empire. If Philip II Augustus supported Philip of Swabia, member of the House of Hohenstaufen, then Richard Lionheart supported Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV, member of the House of Welf. Otto IV had the upper hand and became the Holy Roman Emperor at the expense of Philip of Swabia. The crown of France was saved by Richard's demise after a wound he received fighting his own vassals in Limousin (province)|Limousin.

John of England|John Lackland, Richard's successor, refused to come to the French court for a trial against the Lusignans and, as Louis VI had done often to his rebellious vassals, Philip II confiscated John's possessions in France. John's defeat was swift and his attempts to reconquer his French possession at the decisive Battle of Bouvines (1214) resulted in complete failure. Philip II had annexed Normandy and Anjou, plus capturing the Counts of Boulogne and Flanders, although Aquitaine and Gascony remained loyal to the Plantagenet King. In an additional aftermath of the Battle of Bouvines, John's ally Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV was overthrown by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II, member of the House of Hohenstaufen and ally of Philip. Philip II of France was crucial in ordering Western European politics in both England and France.

Philip Augustus founded La Sorbonne|the Sorbonne and made Paris a city for scholars.

Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis (the future Louis VIII, reigned 1223–26) was involved in the subsequent First Barons War|English civil war as French and English (or rather Anglo-Norman) aristocracies were once one and were now split between allegiances. While the French kings were struggling against the Plantagenets, the Church called for the Albigensian Crusade. Southern France was then largely absorbed in the royal domains.

Saint Louis (1226–1270)
France became a truly centralised kingdom under Louis IX of France|Louis IX (reigned 1226–70). Saint Louis has often been portrayed as a one-dimensional character, a flawless representant of the faith and an administrative reformer who cared for the governed ones. However, his reign was far from perfect for everyone: he made unsuccessful crusades, his expanding administrations raised opposition, and he burned Jewish books at the Pope's urging.<ref>Cite book | last =Gigot | first =Francis E.  | contribution =Judaism | year =1910 | title =The Catholic Encyclopedia | volume =VIII | place=New York | publisher=Robert Appleton Company | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08399a.htm | accessdate =13 August 2007</ref> His judgments were not often practical, although they seemed fair by the standards of the time. It appears Louis had a strong sense of justice and always wanted to judge people himself before applying any sentence. This was said about Louis and French clergy asking for excommunications of Louis' vassals:<ref>Capetian France p. 265.</ref>

quote|''For it would be against God and contrary to right and justice if he compelled any man to seek absolution when the clergy were doing him wrong.''

Louis IX was only twelve years old when he became King of France. His mother — Blanche of Castile — was the effective power as regent (although she did not formally use the title). Blanche's authority was strongly opposed by the French barons yet she maintained her position until Louis was old enough to rule by himself.

In 1229 the King had to struggle with a long lasting University of Paris strike of 1229|strike at the University of Paris. The Latin Quarter|Quartier Latin was strongly hit by these strikes.

The kingdom was vulnerable: war was still going on in the County of Toulouse, and the royal army was occupied fighting resistance in Languedoc. Raymond VII of Toulouse|Count Raymond VII of Toulouse finally signed the Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris in 1229, in which he retained much of his lands for life, but his daughter, married to Alfonso, Count of Poitou|Count Alfonso of Poitou, produced him no heir and so the County of Toulouse went to the King of France.

Henry III of England|King Henry III of England had not yet recognized the Capetian overlordship over Aquitaine and still hoped to recover Normandy and Anjou and reform the Angevin Empire. He landed in 1230 at Saint-Malo with a massive force. Henry III's allies in Brittany and Normandy fell down because they did not dare fight their king, who led the counterstrike himself. This evolved into the Saintonge War (1242).

Ultimately, Henry III was defeated and had to recognise Louis IX's overlordship, although the King of France did not seize Aquitaine from Henry III. Louis IX was now the most important landowner of France, adding to his royal title. There were some opposition to his rule in Normandy, yet it proved remarkably easy to rule, especially compared to the County of Toulouse which had been brutally conquered. The Conseil du Roi, which would evolve into the Parlement, was founded in these times.  After his conflict with Henry III of England|King Henry III of England, Louis established a cordial relation with the Plantagenet King.<ref>Capetian France p. 264.</ref>

Saint Louis also supported new forms of art such as Gothic architecture; his Sainte-Chapelle became a very famous gothic building, and he is also credited for the Morgan Bible.  The Kingdom was involved in two crusades under Saint Louis: the Seventh Crusade and the Eighth Crusade. Both proved to be complete failures for the French King.

Philip III and Philip IV (1270–1314)
Philip III of France|Philip III became king when Saint Louis died in 1270 during the Eighth Crusade. Philip III was called "the Bold" on the basis of his abilities in combat and on horseback, and not because of his character or ruling abilities. Philip III took part in another crusading disaster: the Aragonese Crusade, which cost him his life in 1285.

More administrative reforms were made by Philip IV of France|Philip IV, also called Philip the Fair (reigned 1285–1314). This king was responsible for the end of the Knights Templar, signed the Auld Alliance, and established the Parlement|Parlement of Paris. Philip IV was so powerful that he could name popes and emperors, unlike the early Capetians. The papacy was moved to Avignon Papacy|Avignon and all the contemporary popes were French, such as Philip IV's puppet Pope Clement V|Bertrand de Goth, Pope Clement V.

=Early Valois Kings and the Hundred Years' War (1328–1453)=
File:Capture Jean II.jpg|thumb|The capture of the French king John II of France|John II at Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers in 1356
The tensions between the Houses of Plantagenet and Capetian dynasty|Capet climaxed during the so-called Hundred Years' War (actually several distinct wars over the period 1337 to 1453) when the Plantagenets claimed the throne of France from the Valois. This was also the time of the Black Death, as well as several civil wars. The French population suffered much from these wars. In 1420 by the Treaty of Troyes Henry V of England|Henry V was made heir to Charles VI. Henry V failed to outlive Charles so it was Henry VI of England and France who consolidated the Dual-Monarchy of England and France.

It has been argued that the difficult conditions the French population suffered during the Hundred Years' War awakened French nationalism, a nationalism represented by Joan of Arc (1412–1431). Although this is debatable, the Hundred Years' War is remembered more as a Franco-English war than as a succession of feudal struggles. During this war, France evolved politically and militarily.

Although a Franco-Scottish army was successful at the Battle of Baugé (1421), the humiliating defeats of Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers (1356) and Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt (1415) forced the French nobility to realise they could not stand just as armoured knights without an organised army. Charles VII of France|Charles VII (reigned 1422–61) established the first French standing army, the Compagnies d'ordonnance, and defeated the Plantagenets once at Battle of Patay|Patay (1429) and again, using cannons, at Battle of Formigny|Formigny (1450).  The English under Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII defeated France in 1544-46.<ref>Neil Murphy,  "Violence, Colonization and Henry VIII’s Conquest of France, 1544–1546." ''Past and Present'' 233#1 (2016): 13-51.</ref> The Battle of Castillon (1453) was the last engagement of this war;  Calais and the Channel Islands remained ruled by the Plantagenets.

=Life in the Early Modern period=
main|Ancien Régime

French identity
France in the Ancien Régime covered a territory of around convert|520,000|km2|sqmi. This land supported 13 million people in 1484 and 20 million people in 1700. France had the second largest population in Europe around 1700. Britain had 5 or 6 million, Spain had 8 million, and the Austrian Habsburgs had around 8 million. Russia was the most populated European country at the time. France's lead slowly faded after 1700, as other countries grew faster.<ref>Pierre Goubert, ''The Ancien Régime'' (1973) pp. 2–9.</ref>

The sense of "being French" was uncommon in 1500, as people clung to their local identities.  By 1600, however, people were starting to call themselves "bon françois."<ref name="autogenerated5"/>

Estates and power
Political power was widely dispersed.  The law courts ("Parlements") were powerful, especially that of France.  However, the king had only about 10,000 officials in royal service — very few indeed for such a large country, and with very slow internal communications over an inadequate road system. Travel was usually faster by ocean ship or river boat.<ref name="autogenerated5"/> The different estates of the realm – the clergy, the nobility, and commoners – occasionally met together in the "Estates General (France)|Estates General", but in practice the Estates General had no power, for it could petition the king but could not pass laws.

The Catholic Church controlled about 40% of the wealth, tied up in long-term endowments that could be added to but not reduced. The king (not the pope) nominated bishops, but typically had to negotiate with noble families that had close ties to local monasteries and church establishments.

The nobility came second in terms of wealth, but there was no unity. Each noble had his own lands, his own network of regional connections, and his own military force.<ref name=autogenerated5>Frederick J. Baumgartner, ''France in the Sixteenth Century'' (1995) pp 4–7</ref>

The cities had a quasi-independent status, and were largely controlled by the leading merchants and guilds. Paris was by far the largest city with 220,000 people in 1547 and a history of steady growth. Lyon and Rouen each had about 40,000 population, but Lyon had a powerful banking community and a vibrant culture. Bordeaux was next with only 20,000 population in 1500.<ref name="autogenerated5"/>

Peasants made up the vast majority of population, who in many cases had well-established rights that the authorities had to respect.  In 1484, about 97% of France's 13 million people lived in rural villages; in 1700, at least 80% of the 20 million people population were peasants.

In the 17th century peasants had ties to the market economy, provided much of the capital investment necessary for agricultural growth, and frequently moved from village to village (or town). Geographic mobility, directly tied to the market and the need for investment capital, was the main path to social mobility. The "stable" core of French society, town guildspeople and village labourers, included cases of staggering social and geographic continuity, but even this core required regular renewal.<ref name="amazon1991">James B. Collins, "Geographic and Social Mobility in Early-modern France." ''Journal of Social History'' 1991 24(3): 563–577. ISSN|0022-4529 Fulltext: Ebsco.

Accepting the existence of these two societies, the constant tension between them, and extensive geographic and social mobility tied to a market economy holds the key to a clearer understanding of the evolution of the social structure, economy, and even political system of early modern France. Collins (1991) argues that the Annales School paradigm underestimated the role of the market economy; failed to explain the nature of capital investment in the rural economy; and grossly exaggerated social stability.<ref>James B.

Language
Main|History of French
Although most peasants in France spoke local dialects, an official language emerged in Paris and the French language became the preferred language of Europe's aristocracy. Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V (born in 1500) quipped, "I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse."<ref>cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCobBRiv3_MC&pg=PA299|page=299|title=The letters of George Santayana: 1948–1952, Book 8|author1=George Santayana |author2=William G. Holzberger |publisher=MIT Press, 2008|isbn=978-0-262-19571-3|date=31 July 2008</ref>

Because of its international status, there was a desire to regulate the French language. Several reforms of the French language worked to make it more uniform. The Renaissance writer François Rabelais (born 1494) helped to shape French as a literary language, Rabelais' French is characterised by the re-introduction of Greek and Latin words. Jacques Peletier du Mans (born 1517) was one of the scholars who reformed the French language. He improved Nicolas Chuquet's Long and short scales|long scale system by adding names for intermediate numbers ("milliards" instead of "thousand million", etc.).

With the death in 1477 of Charles the Bold, France and the Habsburgs began a long process of dividing his rich Burgundian lands, leading to numerous wars. In 1532, Brittany was Union between Brittany and France|incorporated into the Kingdom of France.

France engaged in the long Italian Wars (1494–1559), which marked the beginning of early modern France. Francis I of France|Francis I faced powerful foes, and he was captured at Battle of Pavia|Pavia. The French monarchy then sought for allies and found one in the Ottoman Empire. The Barbarossa (Ottoman admiral)|Ottoman Admiral Barbarossa captured Nice in 1543 and handed it down to Francis I.

During the 16th century, the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs were the dominant power in Europe. The many domains of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V encircled France. The Tercio|Spanish Tercio was used with great success against French knights. Finally, on 7 January 1558, the Francis, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise seized Calais from the English.

"Beautiful 16th century"
Economic historians call the era from about 1475 to 1630 the "beautiful 16th century" because of the return of peace, prosperity and optimism across the nation, and the steady growth of population. Paris, for example, flourished as never before, as its population rose to 200,000 by 1550. In Toulouse the Renaissance of the 16th century brought wealth that transformed the architecture of the town, such as building of the great aristocratic houses.<ref>Pierre Goubert, ''The Course of French History'' (1988) pp. 127–34</ref>

Main|French Wars of Religion
File:Henry IV of france by pourbous younger.jpg|thumb|200px|Henry IV of France was the first French House of Bourbon|Bourbon king.
The Protestant Reformation, inspired in France mainly by John Calvin, began to challenge the legitimacy and rituals of the Catholic Church. It reached an elite audience.<ref>cite book|author=R. B. Wernham|title=The New Cambridge Modern History: vol. 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-48AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA91|year=1968|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|pages=91–3|isbn=9780521045438</ref>

Calvin, based securely in Geneva Switzerland, was a Frenchman deeply committed to reforming his homeland. The Protestant movement had been energetic, but lacked central organizational direction. With financial support from the church in Geneva, Calvin turned his enormous energies toward uplifting the French Protestant cause.  As one historian explains:
:He supplied the dogma, the liturgy, and the moral ideas of the new religion, and he also created ecclesiastical, political, and social institutions in harmony with it.  A born leader, he followed up his work with personal appeals.  His vast correspondence with French Protestants shows not only much zeal but infinite pains and considerable tact and driving home the lessons of his printed treatises.<ref>cite book|author=Preserved Smith|title=The Age of the Reformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsywAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA201|year=1920|publisher=H. Holt|page=201</ref>

Between 1555 and 1562, more than 100 ministers were sent to France.  Nevertheless, French King Henry II of France|Henry II severely persecuted Protestants under the Edict of Chateaubriand and when the French authorities complained about the missionary activities, the city fathers of Geneva disclaimed official responsibility.<ref>T.H.L. Parker, ''John Calvin: A Biography'' (2006) pp 161–64.</ref>  The two main Calvinist strongholds were southwest France and Normandy, but even in these districts the Catholics were a majority. Renewed Catholic reaction – headed by the powerful Francis, Duke of Guise – led to a massacre of Huguenots at Wassy|Vassy in 1562, starting the first of the French Wars of Religion, during which English, German, and Spanish forces intervened on the side of rival Protestant ("Huguenot") and Catholic forces.

King Henry II of France|Henry II  died in 1559 in a jousting tournament; he was succeeded in turn by his three sons, each of which assumed the throne as minors or were weak, ineffectual rulers.  In the power vacuum entered Henry's widow, Catherine de' Medici, who became a central figure in the early years of the Wars of Religion.  She is often blamed for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, when thousands of Huguenots were murdered in Paris and the provinces of France.

The Wars of Religion culminated in the War of the Three Henrys (1584–98), at the height of which bodyguards of the King Henry III of France|Henry III assassinated Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry de Guise, leader of the Spanish-backed Catholic League (French)|Catholic league.  In revenge, a priest assassinated Henry III.  This led to the ascension of the Huguenot Henry IV of France|Henry IV; in order to bring peace to a country beset by religious and succession wars, he converted to Catholicism.  "Paris is worth a Mass," he reputedly said. He issued the Edict of Nantes in 1598, which guaranteed religious liberties to the Protestants, thereby effectively ending the civil war.<ref name="autogenerated2005">Mack P. Holt, ''The French Wars of Religion, 1562–1629'' (2nd ed. 2005</ref> The main provisions of the Edict of Nantes were as follows: a) Huguenots were allowed to hold religious services in certain towns in each province, b) They were allowed to control and fortify eight cities (including La Rochelle and Montauban), c) Special courts were established to try Huguenot offenders, d) Huguenots were to have equal civil rights with the Catholics.<ref>cite book|author=S.

When in 1620 the Huguenots proclaimed a constitution for the 'Republic of the Reformed Churches of France', the chief minister Cardinal Richelieu (1585–1642) invoked the entire powers of the state to stop it.  Religious conflicts therefore resumed under Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII when Richelieu forced Protestants to disarm their army and fortresses. This conflict ended in the Siege of La Rochelle (1627–28), in which Protestants and their English supporters were defeated. The following Peace of Alais (1629) confirmed religious freedom yet dismantled the Protestant military defences.<ref>cite book|author=J. H.

The religious conflicts that plagued France also ravaged the Habsburg-led Holy Roman Empire. The Thirty Years' War eroded the power of the Catholic Habsburgs. Although Cardinal Richelieu, the powerful chief minister of France, had mauled the Protestants, he joined this war on their side in 1636 because it was in the National interest|''raison d'État'' (national interest). Imperial Habsburg forces invaded France, ravaged Champagne, France|Champagne, and nearly threatened Paris.<ref name=autogenerated6>Peter H.

Richelieu died in 1642 and was succeeded by Cardinal Mazarin, while Louis XIII died one year later and was succeeded by Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV. France was served by some very efficient commanders such as Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé|Louis II de Bourbon (Condé) and Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Henry de la Tour d'Auvergne (Turenne). The French forces won a decisive victory at Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi (1643), and the Spanish army was decimated; the Tercio was broken. The Truce of Ulm (1647) and the Peace of Westphalia (1648) brought an end to the war.<ref name="autogenerated6"/>

Some challenges remained. France was hit by civil unrest known as the Fronde which in turn evolved into the Franco-Spanish War (1653)|Franco-Spanish War in 1653. Louis II de Bourbon joined the Spanish army this time, but suffered a severe defeat at Battle of the Dunes (1658)|Dunkirk (1658) by Henry de la Tour d'Auvergne.

Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV, known as the "Sun King", reigned over France from 1643 until 1715 although his strongest period of personal rule did not begin until 1661 after the death of his Italian chief minister Cardinal Mazarin. Louis believed in the divine right of kings, which asserts that a monarch is above everyone except God, and is therefore not answerable to the will of his people, the aristocracy, or the Church. Louis continued his predecessors' work of creating a centralized state governed from Paris, sought to eliminate remnants of feudalism in France, and subjugated and weakened the aristocracy. By these means he consolidated a system of absolute monarchical rule in France that endured until the French Revolution. However, Louis XIV's long reign saw France involved in many wars that drained its treasury.<ref name="iearn1">[http://www.iearn.hu/balkans/bpeople/zrinyi.htm Count Miklós Zrínyi, the Poet-Warlord] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103204905/http://www.iearn.hu/balkans/bpeople/zrinyi.htm |date=3 January 2009 </ref>

His reign began during the Thirty Years' War and during the Franco-Spanish war. His military architect, Vauban, became famous for his pentagonal fortresses, and Jean-Baptiste Colbert supported the royal spending as much as possible. French dominated League of the Rhine fought against the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664)|Battle of Saint Gotthard in 1664. The battle was won by the Christians, chiefly through the brave attack of 6,000 French troops led by La Feuillade and Coligny.<ref name="iearn1"/>

France fought the War of Devolution against Habsburg Spain|Spain in 1667. France's defeat of Spain and invasion of the Spanish Netherlands alarmed England and Sweden. With the Dutch Republic they formed the Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance to check Louis XIV's expansion. Louis II de Bourbon had captured Franche-Comté, but in face of an indefensible position, Louis XIV agreed to a peace at Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Aachen.

Peace was fragile, and war broke out again between France and the Dutch Republic in the Franco-Dutch War (1672–78). Louis XIV asked for the Dutch Republic to resume war against the Spanish Netherlands, but the republic refused. France attacked the Dutch Republic and was joined by England in this conflict. Through targeted inundations of polders by breaking dykes, the French invasion of the Dutch Republic was brought to a halt.<ref name="autogenerated706">cite journal |last=Ó Gráda |first=Cormac |author2=Chevet, Jean-Michel |year=2002 |title=Famine And Market In ''Ancient Régime'' France |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=62 |pages=706–733 |doi=10.1017/S0022050702001055 |pmid=17494233 |issue=3|url=http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/368/3/ogradac_article_pub_039.pdf |hdl=10197/368 </ref> The Dutch Admiral Michiel de Ruyter inflicted a few strategic defeats on the Anglo-French naval alliance and forced Treaty of Westminster (1674)|England to retire from the war in 1674. Because the Netherlands could not resist indefinitely, it agreed to peace in the Treaties of Nijmegen, according to which France would annex France-Comté and acquire further concessions in the Spanish Netherlands.

On 6 May 1682, the royal court moved to the lavish Palace of Versailles, which Louis XIV had greatly expanded. Over time, Louis XIV compelled many members of the nobility, especially the noble elite, to inhabit Versailles. He controlled the nobility with an elaborate system of pensions and privileges, and replaced their power with himself.

Peace did not last, and war between France and Spain again resumed.<ref name="autogenerated706"/> The War of the Reunions broke out (1683–84), and again Spain, with its ally the Holy Roman Empire, was easily defeated. Meanwhile, in October 1685 Louis signed the Edict of Fontainebleau ordering the destruction of all Protestant churches and schools in France. Its immediate consequence was a large Protestant exodus from France. Over two million people died in two famines in 1693 and 1710.<ref name="autogenerated706"/>

France would soon be involved in another war, the War of the Grand Alliance. This time the theatre was not only in Europe but also in North America. Although the war was long and difficult (it was also called the Nine Years' War), its results were inconclusive. The Treaty of Ryswick in 1697 confirmed French sovereignty over Alsace, yet rejected its claims to Luxembourg. Louis also had to evacuate Catalonia and the Electorate of the Palatinate|Palatinate. This peace was considered a truce by all sides, thus war was to start again.<ref name=autogenerated2>Wolf, ''Louis XIV'' (1968)</ref>

In 1701 the War of the Spanish Succession began. The Bourbon Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou was designated heir to the throne of Spain as Philip V. The Habsburg Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold opposed a Bourbon succession, because the power that such a succession would bring to the Bourbon rulers of France would disturb the delicate balance of power in international relations|balance of power in Europe. Therefore, he claimed the Spanish thrones for himself.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> England and the Dutch Republic joined Leopold against Louis XIV and Philip of Anjou. The allied forces were led by John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and by Prince Eugene of Savoy. They inflicted a few resounding defeats on the French army; the Battle of Blenheim in 1704 was the first major land battle lost by France since its victory at Rocroi in 1643. Yet, the extremely bloody battles of Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies (1706) and Battle of Malplaquet|Malplaquet (1709) proved to be Pyrrhic victory|Pyrrhic victories for the allies, as they had lost too many men to continue the war.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Led by Claude Louis Hector de Villars|Villars, French forces recovered much of the lost ground in battles such as Battle of Denain|Denain (1712). Finally, a compromise was achieved with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Philip of Anjou was confirmed as Philip V, king of Spain; Emperor Leopold did not get the throne, but Philip V was barred from inheriting France.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

Louis XIV wanted to be remembered as a patron of the arts, like his ancestor Louis IX. He invited Jean-Baptiste Lully to establish the French opera, and a tumultuous friendship was established between Lully and playwright and actor Molière. Jules Hardouin Mansart became France's most important architect of the period, bringing the pinnacle of French Baroque architecture.

The wars were so expensive, and so inconclusive, that although France gained some territory to the east, its enemies gained more strength than it did, Vauban, France's leading military strategist, warned that king in 1689 that a hostile "Alliance" was too powerful at sea. He recommended the best way for France to fight back was to license French merchants ships to privateer and seize enemy merchant ships, while avoiding its navies:
:France has its declared enemies Germany and all the states that it embraces; Spain with all its dependencies in Europe, Asia, Africa and America; the Duke of Savoy [in Italy], England, Scotland, Ireland, and all their colonies in the East and West Indies; and Holland with all its possessions in the four corners of the world where it has great establishments.  France has ... undeclared enemies, indirectly hostile hostile and envious of its greatness, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Portugal, Venice, Genoa, and part of the Swiss Confederation, all of which states secretly aid France's enemies by the troops that they hire to them, the money they lend them and by protecting and covering their trade.<ref>Quoted in Geoffrey Simcox, ed., ''War, Diplomacy, and Imperialism, 1618–1763'' (1974), pp. 236–37.</ref>

Vauban was pessimistic about France's so-called friends and allies and recommended against expensive land wars, or hopeless naval wars: 
:For lukewarm, useless, or impotent friends, France has the Pope, who is indifferent; the King of England [James II] expelled from his country [And living in exile in Paris]; the grand Duke of Tuscany; the Dukes of Mantua, Mokena, and Parma [all in Italy]; and the other faction of the Swiss.  Some of these are sunk in the softness that comes of years of peace, the others are cool in their affections....The English and Dutch are the main pillars of the Alliance; they support it by making war against us in concert with the other powers, and they keep it going by means of the money that they pay every year to... Allies....  We must therefore fall back on privateering as the method of conducting war which is most feasible, simple, cheap, and safe, and which will cost least to the state, the more so since any losses will not be felt by the King, who risks virtually nothing....It will enrich the country, train many good officers for the King, and in a short time force his enemies to sue for peace.<ref>Quoted in Simcox, pp. 237, 242.</ref>

Louis XIV died in 1715 and was succeeded by his five-year-old great grandson who reigned as Louis XV until his death in 1774. In 1718, France was once again at war, as Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philip II of Orléans's regency joined the War of the Quadruple Alliance against Spain. King Philip V of Spain had to withdraw from the conflict, confronted with the reality that Spain was no longer a great power of Europe. Under André-Hercule de Fleury|Cardinal Fleury's administration, peace was maintained as long as possible.<ref name="autogenerated1999">Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie,  ''The Ancien Régime: A History of France 1610–1774'' (1999)</ref>

However, in 1733 another war broke in central Europe, this time about the War of the Polish Succession|Polish succession, and France joined the war against the Austrian Empire. This time there was no invasion of the Netherlands, and Britain remained neutral. As a consequence, Austria was left alone against a Franco-Spanish alliance and faced a military disaster. Peace was settled in the Treaty of Vienna (1738), according to which France would annex, through inheritance, the Lorraine (duchy)|Duchy of Lorraine.<ref name="autogenerated1999"/>

Two years later, in 1740, war broke out over the War of the Austrian Succession|Austrian succession, and France seized the opportunity to join the conflict. The war played out in North America and India as well as Europe, and inconclusive terms were agreed to in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748). Once again, no one regarded this as a peace, but rather as a mere truce. Prussia was then becoming a new threat, as it had gained substantial territory from Austria. This led to the Diplomatic Revolution|Diplomatic Revolution of 1756, in which the alliances seen during the previous war were mostly inverted. France was now allied to Austria and Russia, while Britain was now allied to Prussia.<ref name=autogenerated1>Daniel Marston, ''The Seven Years' War'' (2001)</ref>

In the North American theatre, France was allied with various Native American peoples during the Seven Years' War and, despite a temporary success at the battles of Battle of the Great Meadows|the Great Meadows and Battle of the Monongahela|Monongahela, French forces were defeated at the disastrous Battle of the Plains of Abraham in Quebec. In Europe, repeated French attempts to overwhelm Electorate of Hanover|Hanover failed. In 1762 Russia, France, and Austria were on the verge of crushing Prussia, when the Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|Anglo-Prussian Alliance was saved by the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg. At sea, naval defeats against British fleets at Battle of Lagos|Lagos and Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay in 1759 and a crippling blockade forced France to keep its ships in port. Finally peace was concluded in the Treaty of Paris (1763), and France lost its North American empire.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Britain's success in the Seven Years' War had allowed them to eclipse France as the leading colonial power.  France sought revenge for this defeat, and under Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|Choiseul France started to rebuild. In 1766 the French Kingdom annexed Lorraine and the following year bought Corsica from Republic of Genoa|Genoa.

Having lost its colonial empire, France saw a good opportunity for revenge against Britain in Anglo-French War (1778–83)|signing an alliance with the Americans in 1778, and sending an army and navy that turned the American Revolution into a world war. Spain, allied to France by the Pacte de Famille|Family Compact, and the Dutch Republic also joined the war on the French side. François Joseph Paul de Grasse|Admiral de Grasse defeated a British fleet at Battle of the Chesapeake|Chesapeake Bay while Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau and Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette joined American forces in defeating the British at Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown. The war was concluded by the Treaty of Paris (1783); the United States became independent.

Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of American Revolution'' (1985)</ref>

While the state expanded, new Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas flourished. Montesquieu proposed the separation of powers. Many other French philosophes (intellectuals) exerted philosophical influence on a continental scale, including Voltaire, Denis Diderot and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose essay The Social Contract|The Social Contract, Or Principles of Political Right was a catalyst for governmental and societal reform throughout Europe. Diderot's great ''Encyclopédie'' reshaped the European world view.<ref name="autogenerated1998">Daniel Roche, ''France in the Enlightenment'' (1998) ch 15</ref>

Astronomy, chemistry, mathematics and technology flourished. French scientists such as Antoine Lavoisier worked to replace the archaic units of weights and measures by a coherent scientific system. Lavoisier also formulated the law of Conservation of mass and discovered oxygen and hydrogen.<ref name="autogenerated1998"/>

The "Philosophes" were 18th-century French intellectuals who dominated the French Enlightenment and were influential across Europe. Their interests were diverse, with experts in scientific, literary, philosophical and sociological matters. The ultimate goal of the philosophers was human progress; by concentrating on social and material sciences, they believed that a rational society was the only logical outcome of a freethinking and reasoned populace. They also advocated Deism and religious tolerance. Many believed religion had been used as a source of conflict since time eternal, and that logical, rational thought was the way forward for mankind.<ref>Peter Hanns Reill and Ellen Judy Wilson, ''Encyclopædia of the Enlightenment''(2nd ed. 2004)</ref>

The philosopher Denis Diderot was editor in chief of the famous Enlightenment accomplishment, the 72,000-article ''Encyclopédie'' (1751–72). It sparked a revolution in learning throughout the enlightened world.<ref>Arthur Wilson, ''Diderot, the Appeal to Posterity, 1759–1784'' (1972)</ref>

In the early part of the 18th century the movement was dominated by Voltaire and Montesquieu, but the movement grew in momentum as the century moved on. Overall the philosophers were inspired by the thoughts of René Descartes, the skepticism of the Libertins and the popularization of science by Bernard de Fontenelle. Sectarian dissensions within the church, the gradual weakening of the absolute monarch and the numerous wars of Louis XIV allowed their influence to spread.  Between 1748 and 1751 the Philosophes reached their most influential period, as Montesquieu published ''Spirit of Laws'' (1748) and Jean Jacques Rousseau published ''Discourse on the Moral Effects of the Arts and Sciences'' (1750).

The leader of the French Enlightenment and a writer of enormous influence across Europe, was Voltaire (1694–1778). His many books included poems and plays; works of satire (''Candide'' [1759]); books on history, science, and philosophy, including numerous (anonymous) contributions to the ''Encyclopédie''; and an extensive correspondence.  A witty, tireless antagonist to the alliance between the French state and the church, he was exiled from France on a number of occasions. In exile in England he came to appreciate British thought and he popularized Isaac Newton in Europe.<ref>Nicholas Cronk, ed. ''The Cambridge Companion to Voltaire'' (2009)</ref>

When King Louis XV of France|Louis XV died in 1774 he left his grandson, Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI, "A heavy legacy, with ruined finances, unhappy subjects, and a faulty and incompetent government." Regardless, "the people, meanwhile, still had confidence in royalty, and the accession of Louis XVI was welcomed with enthusiasm."<ref>William J Roberts, ''France: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present'' (2004) p. 34</ref>

A decade later, recent wars, especially the Seven Years' War (1756–63) and the American Revolutionary War (1775–83), had effectively bankrupted the state. The taxation system was highly inefficient. Several years of bad harvests and an inadequate transportation system had caused rising food prices, hunger, and malnutrition; the country was further destabilized by the lower classes' increased feeling that the royal court was isolated from, and indifferent to, their hardships.

In February 1787, the king's finance minister, Charles Alexandre de Calonne, convened an Assembly of Notables, a group of nobles, clergy, bourgeoisie, and bureaucrats selected in order to bypass the local parliaments. This group was asked to approve a new land tax that would, for the first time, include a tax on the property of nobles and clergy. The assembly did not approve the tax, and instead demanded that Louis XVI call the Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General.

File:Le Serment du Jeu de paume.jpg|thumb|280px|The Tennis Court Oath of 20 June 1789 was a pivotal event during the first days of the Revolution. It signified the first time that French citizens formally stood in opposition to Louis XVI.

= National Assembly, Paris anarchy and storming the Bastille (January–14 July 1789) =
In August 1788 the King agreed to convene the Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General in May 1789. While the Third Estate demanded and was granted "double representation" so as to balance the First and Second Estate, voting was to occur "by orders" – votes of the Third Estate were to be weighted – effectively canceling double representation. This eventually led to the Third Estate breaking away from the Estates-General and, joined by members of the other estates, proclaiming the creation of the National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly, an assembly not of the Estates but of "the People."

In an attempt to keep control of the process and prevent the Assembly from convening, Louis XVI ordered the closure of the Salle des États where the Assembly met. After finding the door to their chamber locked and guarded, the Assembly met nearby on a tennis court and pledged the Tennis Court Oath on 20 June 1789, binding them "never to separate, and to meet wherever circumstances demand, until the constitution of the kingdom is established and affirmed on solid foundations." They were joined by some sympathetic members of the Second and First estates. After the king fired his finance minister, Jacques Necker, for giving his support and guidance to the Third Estate, worries surfaced that the legitimacy of the newly formed National Assembly might be threatened by royalists.

Paris was soon in a state of anarchy. It was consumed with riots and widespread looting. Because the royal leadership essentially abandoned the city, the mobs soon had the support of the French Guard, including arms and trained soldiers. On 14 July 1789, the insurgents set their eyes on the large weapons and ammunition cache inside the Bastille fortress, which also served as a symbol of royal tyranny. Insurgents Storming of the Bastille|seized the Bastille prison, killing the governor and several of his guards.

Although peace was made, several nobles did not regard the new order as acceptable and emigrated in order to push the neighboring, aristocratic kingdoms to war against the new regime. The state was now struck for several weeks in July and August 1789 by violence against aristocracy, also called 'Great Fear|the Great Fear'.

The Assembly also replaced France's historic provinces with eighty-three departments, uniformly administered and approximately equal to one another in extent and population.

The King had to share power with the elected Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly, although he still retained his royal veto and the ability to select ministers. He had perforce to swear an oath to the constitution, and a decree declared that retracting the oath, heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to de facto abdication.

With rivalry, even enmity, in the National Convention and its predecessors between so-called 'The Mountain|Montagnards' and 'Girondins' smouldering ever since late 1791, Jacques Hébert, Convention member leaning to the 'Montagnards' group, on 24 May 1793 called on the ''sans-culottes''—the idealized simple, non-aristocratic, hard-working, upright, patriotic, republican, Paris labourers—to rise in revolt against the "henchmen of Louis XVI of France|Capet [= the killed ex-king] and Charles François Dumouriez|Dumouriez [= the defected general]". Hébert was arrested immediately by a Convention committee investigating Paris rebelliousness. While that committee consisted only of members from The Plain|la Plaine and the Girondins, the anger of the sans-culottes was directed towards the Girondins. 25 May, a delegation of Paris Commune (French Revolution)|''la Commune'' (the Paris city council) protested against Hébert’s arrest. The Convention’s President Isnard, a Girondin, answered them: "Members of ''la Commune'' (…) If by your incessant rebellions something befalls to the representatives of the nation, I declare, in the name of France, that Paris will be totally obliterated".<ref name=Shus-6/>

On 2 June 1793, the Convention's session in Tuileries Palace—since early May their venue—not for the first time degenerated into chaos and pandemonium. This time crowds of people including 80,000 armed soldiers swarmed in and around the palace. Incessant screaming from the public galeries, always in favour of the Montagnards, suggested that all of Paris was against the Girondins, which was not really the case. Petitions circulated, indicting and condemning 22 Girondins. Barère, member of the Committee of Public Safety, suggested: to end this division which is harming the Republic, the Girondin leaders should lay down their offices voluntarily. A decree was adopted that day by the Convention, after much tumultuous debate, expelling 22 leading Girondins from the Convention.

Maximilien Robespierre, since July 1793 member of the Committee of Public Safety|Committee of Public Prosperity,<ref name=Shus-7/> on 5 February 1794 in a speech in the Convention identified Jacques Hébert and his faction as "internal enemies" working toward the triumph of tyranny.

The frequency of guillotine executions in Paris now rose from on average three a day to an average of 29 a day.<ref name=NoahShus-Ch.8/>

Meanwhile, French Revolutionary Wars#1794|France's external wars were going well, with Flanders Campaign#The French counter-offensive|victories over Austrian and British troops in May and June 1794 opening up Belgium for French conquest.<ref name=NoahShus-Ch.8/> However, cooperation within the Committee of Public Safety, since April 1793 the ''de facto'' executive government, started to break down. On 29 June 1794, three colleagues of Robespierre at the Committee of Public Safety|Committee called him a dictator in his face – Robespierre baffled left the meeting. This encouraged other Convention members to also defy Robespierre. On 26 July, a long and vague speech of Robespierre wasn't met with thunderous applause as usual but with hostility; some deputies yelled that Robespierre should have the courage to say which deputies he deemed necessary to be killed next, which Robespierre refused to do.<ref name=NoahShus-Ch.8/>

In the Convention session of 27 July 1794, Robespierre and his allies hardly managed to say a word as they were constantly interrupted by a row of critics such as Tallien, Billaud-Varenne, Vadier, Barère and acting president Thuriot. Finally, even Robespierre's own voice failed on him: it faltered at his last attempt to beg permission to speak. 9 Thermidor (Fall of Robespierre)#Arrest of Robespierre and associates|A decree was adopted to arrest Robespierre, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just and Georges Couthon|Couthon. 28 July, they and 19 others were beheaded. 29 July, again 70 Parisians were guillotined.<ref name=NoahShus-Ch.8/> Subsequently, the Law of 22 Prairial|Law of 22 Prairial (10 June 1794) was repealed, and the 'Girondins' expelled from the National Convention|Convention  in June 1793, if not dead yet, were reinstated as Convention deputies.<ref name=NoahShus-Ch.9>Noah Shusterman – ''The French Revolution.

But no Convention member sympathized, they just told the women to return home. Again in May a crowd of 20,000 men and 40,000 women invaded the Convention and even killed a deputy in the halls, but again they failed to make the Convention take notice of the needs of the lower classes. Instead, the Convention banned women from all political assemblies, and deputies who had solidarized with this insurrection were sentenced to death: such allegiance between parliament and street fighting was no longer tolerated.<ref name=NoahShus-Ch.9/>

= Fighting Catholicism and royalism (October 1795–November 1799) =
In October 1795, the Republic was reorganised, replacing the one-chamber parliament (the National Convention) by a bi-cameral system: the first chamber called the 'Council of Five Hundred|Council of 500' initiating the laws, the second the 'Council of Ancients|Council of Elders' reviewing and approving or not the passed laws. Each year, one-third of the chambers was to be renewed.

<br>The early directors did not much understand the nation they were governing; they especially had an innate inability to see Catholic Church|Catholicism as anything else than counter-revolutionary and royalist.

Parliamentary elections in the spring of 1797 resulted in considerable gains for the royalists. This frightened the republican directors and they staged a coup d'état on 4 September 1797 (Coup of 18 Fructidor|Coup of 18 Fructidor V) to remove two supposedly pro-royalist directors and some prominent royalists from both Councils.<ref name=NoahShus-Ch.9/>
The new, 'corrected' government, still strongly convinced that Catholicism and royalism were equally dangerous to the Republic, started a fresh campaign to promote the French Republican Calendar|Republican calendar officially introduced in 1792, with its ten-day week, and tried to hallow the tenth day, French Republican Calendar#Ten days of the week|''décadi'', as substitute for the Lord's Day|Christian Sunday.

During the War of the First Coalition (1792–97), the French Directory|Directoire had replaced the National Convention. Five directors then ruled France. As Great Britain was still at war with France, a plan was made to French invasion of Egypt (1798)|take Egypt from the Ottoman Empire, a British ally. This was Napoleon's idea and the Directoire agreed to the plan in order to send the popular general away from the mainland. Napoleon defeated the Ottoman forces during the Battle of the Pyramids (21 July 1798) and sent hundreds of scientists and linguists out to thoroughly explore modern and ancient Egypt. Only a few weeks later the British fleet under Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Horatio Nelson unexpectedly destroyed the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile (1–3 August 1798). Napoleon planned to move into Syria but was defeated and he returned to France without his army, which surrendered.<ref>Paul Strathern, ''Napoleon in Egypt'' (2009)</ref>

The Directoire was threatened by the War of the Second Coalition|Second Coalition (1798–1802). Royalists and their allies still dreamed of restoring the monarchy to power, while the Prussian and Austrian crowns did not accept their territorial losses during the previous war. In 1799 the Russian army expelled the French from Italy in battles such as Battle of Cassano (1799)|Cassano, while the Austrian army defeated the French in Switzerland at Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach and First Battle of Zürich|Zurich. Napoleon then seized power through a coup and established the French Consulate|Consulate in 1799.

While at sea Louis-René Levassor de Latouche Tréville|the French had some success at Boulogne but Nelson's Royal Navy destroyed an anchored Danish and Norwegian fleet at the Battle of Copenhagen (1801) because the Scandinavian kingdoms were against the British blockade of France.

A brief interlude of peace ensued in 1802-3, during which Napoleon Louisiana Purchase|sold French Louisiana to the United States because it was indefensible.<ref name="George F. Nafziger 2002"/>

In 1801 Napoleon concluded a "Concordat" with Pope Pius VII that opened peaceful relations between church and state in France. The policies of the Revolution were reversed, except the Church did not get its lands back. Bishops and clergy were to receive state salaries, and the government would pay for the building and maintenance of churches.<ref>Nigel Aston, ''Religion and revolution in France, 1780–1804'' (2000) p. 324</ref>  Napoleon reorganized higher learning by dividing the ''Institut National'' into four (later five) academies.

In 1804 Napoleon was titled Emperor by the senate, thus founding the First French Empire. Napoleon's rule was constitutional, and although autocratic, it was much more advanced than traditional European monarchies of the time.  The proclamation of the French Empire was met by the War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition. The French army was renamed ''La Grande Armée'' in 1805 and Napoleon used propaganda and nationalism to control the French population. The French army achieved a resounding victory at Battle of Ulm|Ulm (16–19 October 1805), where an entire Austrian army was captured.<ref name="Robert P. Goetz 2005">Robert P.

A Franco-Spanish fleet was defeated at Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar (21 October 1805) and all plans to invade Britain were then made impossible. Despite this naval defeat, it was on the ground that this war would be won; Napoleon inflicted on the Austrian and Russian Empires one of their greatest defeats at Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz (also known as the "Battle of the Three Emperors" on 2 December 1805), destroying the Third Coalition. Peace was settled in the Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg; the Austrian Empire lost the title of Holy Roman Emperor and the Confederation of the Rhine was created by Napoleon over former Austrian territories.<ref name="Robert P.

=Coalitions formed against Napoleon=
Prussia joined Britain and Russia, thus forming the War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition. Although the Coalition was joined by other allies, the French Empire was also not alone since it now had a complex network of allies and subject states.  The largely outnumbered French army crushed the Prussian army at Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt in 1806; Napoleon captured Berlin and went as far as Eastern Prussia. There the Russian Empire was defeated at the Battle of Friedland (14 June 1807). Peace was dictated in the Treaties of Tilsit, in which Russia had to join the Continental System, and Prussia handed half of its territories to France. The Duchy of Warsaw was formed over these territorial losses, and Polish troops entered the Grande Armée in significant numbers.<ref>Frederick Kagan, ''The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801–1805''  (2007). pp. 141ff.</ref>

In order to ruin the British economy, Napoleon set up the Continental System in 1807, and tried to prevent merchants across Europe from trading with British. The large amount of smuggling frustrated Napoleon, and did more harm to his economy than to his enemies.<ref>Georges Lefebvre, ''Napoleon:  From Tilsit to Waterloo, 1807–1815'' (1969) pp 1–32, 205–262</ref>

Freed from his obligation in the east, Napoleon then went back to the west, as the French Empire was still at war with Britain. Only two countries remained neutral in the war: Sweden and Portugal, and Napoleon then looked toward the latter. In the Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807), a Franco-Spanish alliance against Portugal was sealed as Spain eyed Portuguese territories. French armies entered Spain in order to attack Portugal, but then seized Spanish fortresses and took over the kingdom by surprise. Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother, was made King of Spain after Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV abdicated.<ref>Michael Glover, ''Legacy of glory: the Bonaparte kingdom of Spain, 1808–1813'' (1971).</ref>

This occupation of the Iberian peninsula fueled local nationalism, and soon the Spanish and Portuguese fought the French using guerilla tactics, defeating the French forces at the Battle of Bailén (June and July 1808). Britain sent a short-lived ground support force to Portugal, and French forces evacuated Portugal as defined in the Convention of Sintra following the Allied victory at Battle of Vimeiro|Vimeiro (21 August 1808). France only controlled Catalonia and Navarre and could have been definitely expelled from the Iberian peninsula had the Spanish armies attacked again, but the Spanish did not.<ref>Henry Lachouque, et al. ''Napoleon's War in Spain: The French Peninsular Campaigns, 1807–1814'' (1994)</ref>

Another French attack was launched on Spain, led by Napoleon himself, and was described as "an avalanche of fire and steel." However, the French Empire was no longer regarded as invincible by European powers. In 1808 Austria formed the War of the Fifth Coalition in order to break down the French Empire. The Austrian Empire defeated the French at Battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern-Essling, yet was beaten at Battle of Wagram|Wagram while the Polish allies defeated the Austrian Empire at Battle of Raszyn (1809)|Raszyn (April 1809). Although not as decisive as the previous Austrian defeats, the Treaty of Schönbrunn|peace treaty in October 1809 stripped Austria of a large amount of territories, reducing it even more.

In 1812 war broke out with Russia, engaging Napoleon in the disastrous French invasion of Russia (1812). Napoleon assembled the largest army Europe had ever seen, including troops from all subject states, to invade Russia, which had just left the continental system and was gathering an army on the Polish frontier. Following an exhausting march and the bloody but inconclusive Battle of Borodino, near Moscow, the Grande Armée entered and captured Moscow, only to find it burning as part of the Russian scorched earth tactics.
Although there still were battles, the Napoleonic army left Russia in late 1812 annihilated, most of all by the Russian winter, exhaustion, and scorched earth warfare. On the Spanish front the French troops were defeated at Battle of Vitoria|Vitoria (June 1813) and then at the Battle of the Pyrenees (July–August 1813). Since the Spanish guerrillas seemed to be uncontrollable, the French troops eventually evacuated Spain.<ref>Lefebvre, ''Napoleon:  From Tilsit to Waterloo, 1807–1815'' (1969) pp 309–52</ref>

Since France had been defeated on these two fronts, states that had been conquered and controlled by Napoleon saw a good opportunity to strike back. The War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition was formed under British leadership.<ref>Rory Muir, ''Britain and the Defeat of Napoleon, 1807–1815'' (1996).</ref> The German states of the Confederation of the Rhine switched sides, finally opposing Napoleon. Napoleon was largely defeated in the Battle of Leipzig|Battle of the Nations outside Leipzig in October 1813, his forces heavily outnumbered by the Allied coalition armies and was overwhelmed by much larger armies during the Six Days Campaign (February 1814), although, the Six Days Campaign is often considered a tactical masterpiece because the allies suffered much higher casualties. Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814, and was exiled to Elba.<ref>Andrew Roberts,  ''Napoleon: A Life '' (2014) pp 662–712</ref>

The Conservative Order|conservative Congress of Vienna reversed the political changes that had occurred during the wars. Napoleon suddenly returned, seized control of France, raised an army, and marched on his enemies in the Hundred Days. It ended with his final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, and his exile to a remote island.<ref>Lefebvre, ''Napoleon:  From Tilsit to Waterloo, 1807–1815'' (1969) pp 353–72</ref>

The monarchy was subsequently restored and Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII, Younger brother of Louis XVI became king, and the exiles returned. However many of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic reforms were kept in place.<ref>John Hall Stewart, ''The restoration era in France, 1814–1830'' (1968).</ref>

=Napoleon's impact on France=
Napoleon centralized power in Paris, with all the provinces governed by all-powerful prefects whom he selected. They were more powerful than royal intendants of the ancien régime and had a long-term impact in unifying the nation, minimizing regional differences, and shifting all decisions to Paris.<ref>Pierre Goubert, ''The Course of French History'' (1991) ch 14</ref>

Religion had been a major issue during the Revolution, and Napoleon resolved most of the outstanding problems. Thereby he moved the clergy and large numbers of devout Catholics from hostility to the government to support for him.  The Catholic system was reestablished by the Concordat of 1801 (signed with Pope Pius VII), so that church life returned to normal; the church lands were not restored, but the Jesuits were allowed back in and the bitter fights between the government and Church ended. Protestant, Jews and atheists were tolerated.<ref>D. M. G. Sutherland, ''The French Revolution and Empire: The Quest for a Civic Order'' (2003)  pp 329–33</ref>

The French taxation system had collapsed in the 1780s. In the 1790s the government seized and sold church lands and lands of exiles aristocrats. Napoleon instituted a modern, efficient tax system that guaranteed a steady flow of revenues and made long-term financing possible.<ref>Georges Lefebvre, ''Napoleon: From Tilsit to Waterloo 1807–1815'' (1969) pp 171–79</ref>

Napoleon kept the system of conscription that had been created in the 1790s, so that every young man served in the army, which could be rapidly expanded even as it was based on a core of careerists and talented officers.  Before the Revolution the aristocracy formed the officer corps.  Now promotion was by merit and achievement—every private carried a marshal's baton, it was said.<ref>Sutherland, ''The French Revolution and Empire: The Quest for a Civic Order'' (2003) pp. 336–72</ref>

The modern era of French education began in the 1790s. The Revolution in the 1790s abolished the traditional universities.<ref>Howard Clive Barnard, ''Education and the French Revolution'' (1969).</ref> Napoleon sought to replace them with new institutions, the École Polytechnique, focused on technology.<ref>Margaret Bradley,  "Scientific Education for a New Society The Ecole<!--[sic; no accent]--> Polytechnique 1795–1830." ''History of Education'' (1976) 5#1 (1976), pp. 11–24.</ref>  The elementary schools received little attention.

Napoleonic Code
Of permanent importance was the Napoleonic Code created by eminent jurists under Napoleon's supervision. Praised for its Gallic clarity, it spread rapidly throughout Europe and the world in general, and marked the end of feudalism and the liberation of serfs where it took effect.<ref>Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003)</ref>  The Code recognized the principles of civil liberty, equality before the law, and the secular character of the state. It discarded the old right of primogeniture (where only the eldest son inherited) and required that inheritances be divided equally among all the children.  The court system was standardized; all judges were appointed by the national government in Paris.<ref>Goubert (1991) ch 14</ref>

Long 19th century, 1815–1914
Main|France in the long 19th century|History of French foreign relations
The century after the fall of Napoleon I was politically unstable. As Tombs points out:
:Every head of state from 1814 to 1873 spent part of his life in exile. Every regime was the target of assassination attempts of a frequency that put Spanish and Russian politics in the shade. Even in peaceful times governments changed every few months. In less peaceful times, political deaths, imprisonments and deportations are literally incalculable.<ref>cite book|author=Robert Tombs|title=France 1814–1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTagBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT15|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=15|isbn=9781317871439</ref>

France was no longer the dominant power it had been before 1814, but it played a major role in European economics, culture, diplomacy and military affairs. The Bourbons were restored, but left a weak record and one branch was overthrown in 1830 and the other branch in 1848 as Napoleon's nephew was elected president. He made himself emperor as Napoleon III, but was overthrown when he was defeated and captured by Prussians in an 1870 war that humiliated France and made the new nation of Germany dominant in the continent. The Third Republic was established, but the possibility of a return to monarchy remained into the 1880s. The French built up an empire, especially in Africa and Indochina. The economy was strong, with a good railway system.  The arrival of the Rothschild banking family of France in 1812 guaranteed the role of Paris alongside London as a major center of international finance.

=Permanent changes in French society=
The French Revolution and Napoleonic eras brought a series of major changes to France which the Bourbon restoration did not reverse. First of all, France became highly centralized, with all decisions made in Paris. The political geography was completely reorganized and made uniform.  France was divided into 80+ departments, which have endured into the 21st century. Each department had the identical administrative structure, and was tightly controlled by a prefect appointed by Paris. The complex multiple overlapping legal jurisdictions of the old regime had all been abolished, and there was now one standardized legal code, administered by judges appointed by Paris, and supported by police under national control.  Education was centralized, with the Grande Master of the University of France controlling every element of the entire educational system from Paris. Newly technical universities were opened in Paris which to this day have a critical role in training the elite.

Conservatism was bitterly split into the old aristocracy that returned, and the new elites that arose after 1796. The old aristocracy was eager to regain its land but felt no loyalty to the new regime. The new elite--the "noblesse d'empire," ridiculed the other group as an outdated remnant of a discredited regime that had led the nation to disaster. Both groups shared a fear of social disorder, but the level of distrust as well as the cultural differences were too great and the monarchy too inconsistent in its policies for political cooperation to be possible.<ref>Gordon K. Anderson, "Old Nobles and Noblesse d'Empire, 1814–1830: In Search of a Conservative Interest in Post-Revolutionary France." ''French History'' 8.2 (1994): 149-166.</ref>

The old aristocracy had returned, and recovered much of the land they owned directly.  However they completely lost all their old seigneurial rights to the rest of the farmland, and the peasants no longer were under their control. The old aristocracy had dallied with the ideas of the Enlightenment and rationalism. Now the aristocracy was much more conservative, and much more supportive of the Catholic Church. For the best jobs meritocracy was the new policy, and aristocrats had to compete directly with the growing business and professional class.  Anti-clerical sentiment became much stronger than ever before, but was now based in certain elements of the middle class and indeed the peasantry as well.

in France, as in most of Europe, the sum total of wealth was concentrated.  The richest 10 percent of families, owned between 80 and 90 percent of the wealth from 1810 to 1914. Their share then fell to about 60 percent, where it remained into the 21st century. The share of the top one percent of the population grew from 45 percent in 1810 to 60 percent in 1914, then fell steadily to 20 percent in 1970 to the present. <ref>Thomas Piketty, ''Capital in the Twenty-First Century'' (2014) pp 339-45. For much more detailed coverage, see Thomas Piketty, ''Top Incomes in France in the Twentieth Century: Inequality and Redistribution, 1901–1998'' (2018).</ref>

The "200 families" controlled much of the nation's wealth after 1815. The "200" is based on the policy that of the 40,000 shareholders of the Bank of France, only 200 were allowed to attend the annual meeting and they cast all the votes.<ref>Theodore Zeldin, ''France 1848-1945, Vol. 1: Ambition, Love, and Politics'' (1973) pp 53-62.</ref>  Out of a nation of 27 million people, only 80,000 to 90,000 were allowed to vote in 1820, and the richest one-fourth of them had two votes.<ref>Alan B. Spitzer, "Restoration Political Theory and the Debate over the Law of the Double Vote" ''Journal of Modern History'' 55#1 (1983) pp. 54-70 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1878978 online]</ref>

The great masses of the French people were peasants in the countryside, or impoverished workers in the cities.  They gained new rights, and a new sense of possibilities. Although relieved of many of the old burdens, controls, and taxes, the peasantry was still highly traditional in its social and economic behavior. Many eagerly took on mortgages to buy as much land as possible for their children, so debt was an important factor in their calculations.  The working class in the cities was a small element, and had been freed of many restrictions imposed by medieval guilds. However France was very slow to industrialize (in the sense of large factories using modern machinery), and much of the work remained drudgery without machinery or technology to help. This provided a good basis for small-scale expensive luxury crafts that attracted an international upscale market.  France was still localized, especially in terms of language, but now there was an emerging French nationalism that showed its national pride in the Army, and foreign affairs.<ref>John B. Wolf,  ''France: 1814–1919: The Rise Of A Liberal Democratic Society'' (2nd ed. 1962 pp 4–27</ref><ref>Peter McPhee, ''A social history of France 1780–1880'' (1992) pp 93–173</ref>

=Religion=
Main|Religion in France# History
The Catholic Church lost all its lands and buildings during the Revolution, and these were sold off or came under the control of local governments. The bishop still ruled his diocese (which was aligned with the new department boundaries), but could only communicate with the pope through the government in Paris. Bishops, priests, nuns and other religious people were paid salaries by the state. All the old religious rites and ceremonies were retained, and the government maintained the religious buildings. The Church was allowed to operate its own seminaries and to some extent local schools as well, although this became a central political issue into the 20th century. Bishops were much less powerful than before, and had no political voice. However, the Catholic Church reinvented itself and put a new emphasis on personal religiosity that gave it a hold on the psychology of the faithful.<ref>James McMillan, "Catholic Christianity in France from the Restoration to the separation of church and state, 1815–1905." in Sheridan Gilley and Brian Stanley, eds. ''The Cambridge history of Christianity''  (2014) 8: 217–232.</ref>

France remained basically Catholic. The 1872 census counted 36 million people, of whom 35.4 million were listed as Catholics, 600,000 as Protestants, 50,000 as Jews and 80,000 as freethinkers.  The Revolution failed to destroy the Catholic Church, and Napoleon's concordat of 1801 restored its status. The return of the Bourbons in 1814 brought back many rich nobles and landowners who supported the Church, seeing it as a bastion of conservatism and monarchism. However the monasteries with their vast land holdings and political power were gone; much of the land had been sold to urban entrepreneurs who lacked historic connections to the land and the peasants.<ref name="Robert Gildea 2008 p. 120">Robert Gildea, ''Children of the Revolution: The French, 1799–1914''(2008) p. 120</ref>

Few new priests were trained in the 1790–1814 period, and many left the church. The result was that the number of parish clergy plunged from 60,000 in 1790 to 25,000 in 1815, many of them elderly.  Entire regions, especially around Paris, were left with few priests. On the other hand, some traditional regions held fast to the faith, led by local nobles and historic families.<ref name="Robert Gildea 2008 p. 120"/>

The comeback was very slow in the larger cities and industrial areas. With systematic missionary work and a new emphasis on liturgy and devotions to the Virgin Mary, plus support from Napoleon III, there was a comeback.  In 1870 there were 56,500 priests, representing a much younger and more dynamic force in the villages and towns, with a thick network of schools, charities and lay organizations.<ref>Roger Price, ''A Social History of Nineteenth-Century France'' (1987) ch 7</ref>  Conservative Catholics held control of the national government, 1820–30, but most often played secondary political roles or had to fight the assault from republicans, liberals, socialists and seculars.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age.

=Economy=
further|Economic history of France
French economic history since its late-18th century Revolution was tied to three major events and trends: the Napoleonic Era, the competition with Britain and its other neighbors in regards to 'industrialization', and the 'total wars' of the late-19th and early 20th centuries.  Quantitative analysis of output data shows the French per capita growth rates were slightly smaller than Britain. However the British population tripled in size, while France grew by only third—so the overall British economy grew much faster.   François Crouzet has succinctly summarized the ups and downs of French per capita economic growth in 1815–1913 as follows:<ref>François Crouzet "French Economic Growth in the 19th century reconsidered", ''History'' 59#196, (1974) pp 167–179 at p 171.</ref> <br>
1815–1840: irregular, but sometimes fast growth<br>
1840–1860: fast growth; <br>
1860–1882: slowing down; <br>
1882–1896: stagnation; <br>
1896–1913: fast growth<br>

For the 1870–1913 era, the growth rates for 12 Western advanced countries—10 in Europe  plus the United States and Canada show that in terms of per capita growth, France was about average.<ref>Angus Maddison, ''Economic Growth in the West'' (1964) pp 28, 30, 37.</ref>  However its population growth was very slow, so as far as the growth rate in total size of the economy France was in next to the last place, just ahead of Italy.  The 12 countries averaged 2.7% per year in total output, but France only averaged 1.6%.<ref>Crouzet, "French Economic Growth in the 19th century reconsidered", p 169.</ref>  Crouzet concludes that the: 
:average size of industrial undertakings was smaller in France than in other advanced countries; that machinery was generally less up to date, productivity lower, costs higher. The domestic system and handicraft production long persisted, while big modern factories were for long exceptional.  Large lumps of the Ancien Régime economy survived....On the whole, the qualitative lag between the British and French economy...persisted during the whole period under consideration, and later on a similar lag developed between France and some other countries—Belgium, Germany, the United States. France did not succeed in catching up with Britain, but was overtaken by several of her rivals.<ref>Crouzet, "French Economic Growth in the 19th century reconsidered", p 172.</ref>

File:Réception de Louis XVIII à l'Hôtel de Ville, 29 août 1814.jpg|thumb|250px|Louis XVIII makes a return at the Hôtel de Ville de Paris on August 29th, 1814.

This period of time is called the Bourbon Restoration and was marked by conflicts between reactionary Ultra-royalists, who wanted to restore the pre-1789 system of absolute monarchy, and liberals, who wanted to strengthen constitutional monarchy. Louis XVIII was the younger brother of Louis XVI, and reigned from 1814 to 1824. On becoming king, Louis issued a constitution known as the Charter which preserved many of the liberties won during the French Revolution and provided for a parliament composed of an elected Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Peers that was nominated by the king.<ref name="Albert Guerard 1959 p. 293">Albert Guerard, ''France: A Modern History'' (1959) p. 293.</ref>
Evaluation
After two decades of war and revolution, the restoration  brought peace and quiet, and general prosperity. Gordon Wright (historian)|Gordon Wright says, "Frenchmen were, on the whole, well governed, prosperous, contented during the 15 year period; one historian even describes the restoration era as 'one of the happiest periods in [France's] history."<ref> Gordon Wright, ''France and Modern Times'' (5th ed. 1995) p 105, quoting  Bertier de Sauvigny.</ref>

France had recovered from the strain and disorganization, the wars, the killings, and the horrors of two decades of disruption. It was at peace throughout the period. It paid a large war indemnity to the winners, but managed to finance that without distress; the occupation soldiers left peacefully.  Population increased by 3 millions, and prosperity was strong from 1815 to 1825,  with the depression of 1825 caused by bad harvests. The national credit was strong, there was significant increase in public wealth, and the national budget showed a surplus every year. In the private sector, banking grew dramatically, making Paris a world center for finance, along with London. The Rothschild family was world-famous, with the French branch led by James Mayer de Rothschild (1792–1868). The communication system was improved, as roads were upgraded, canals were lengthened, and steamboat traffic became common. Industrialization was delayed in comparison to Britain and Belgium. The railway system had yet to make an appearance. Industry was heavily protected with tariffs, so there was little demand for entrepreneurship or innovation.<ref>J.P.T. Bury, ''France 1814 – 1940'' (1949)  pp 41-42.</ref><ref>J. H. Clapham, '' The Economic Development of France and Germany 1815-1914'' (1936) pp 53-81, 104-7, 121-27.</ref>

Culture flourished with the new romantic impulses. Oratory was highly regarded, and debates were very high standard. Châteaubriand and Madame de Stael (1766-1817) enjoyed Europe-wide reputations for their innovations in romantic literature. She made important contributions to political sociology, and the sociology of literature.<ref>Germaine de Stael and Monroe Berger, ''Politics, Literature, and National Character'' (2000) </ref>  History flourished; François Guizot, Benjamin Constant and Madame de Staël drew lessons from the past to guide the future.<ref>Lucian Robinson,  "Accounts of early Christian history in the thought of François Guizot, Benjamin Constant and Madame de Staël 1800–c. 1833."

Music, theater, science, and philosophy all flourished.<ref>Michael Marrinan, ''Romantic Paris: histories of a cultural landscape, 1800-1850'' (2009).</ref>  The higher learning flourished at the Sorbonne. Major new institutions gave France world leadership in numerous advanced fields, as typified by the École Nationale des Chartes (1821) for historiography, the École Centrale Paris|École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in 1829 for innovative engineering; and the École des Beaux-Arts for the fine arts, reestablished in 1830.<ref>cite book|author=Pierre Bourdieu|title=The State Nobility: Elite Schools in the Field of Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=do9o-jIrzXgC&pg=PA133|year=1998|publisher=Stanford UP|pages=133–35|isbn=9780804733465</ref>

Overall, the Bourbon government's handling of foreign affairs was success. France kept a low profile, and Europe forgot of its animosities. Louis and Charles had little interest in foreign affairs, so France played only minor roles.  Its army helped restore the Spanish monarch in 1823. It helped the other powers deal with Greece and Turkey.  Charles X of France|King Charles X, an ultra reactionary, mistakenly thought that foreign glory would cover domestic frustration, so he made an all-out effort to conquer Algiers in 1830. He sent a massive force of 38,000 soldiers and 4500 horses carried by 103 warships and 469 merchant ships. The expedition was a dramatic military success in only three weeks.<ref>Nigel Falls, "The Conquest of Algiers," ''History Today'' (2005) 55#10 pp 44-51. </ref> The invasion paid for itself with 48 million francs from the captured treasury. The episode launched the second French colonial empire, but it did not provide desperately needed political support for the King at home. Charles X repeatedly exacerbated internal tensions, and tried to neutralize his enemies with repressive measures. He depended too heavily upon his inept chief minister Jules, prince de Polignac|Polignac.  Repression failed and a quick sudden revolution forced Charles into exile for the third time.  <ref>Bury, ''France 1814–1940'' (1949)  pp 43-44.</ref>

Protest against the absolute monarchy was in the air. The elections of deputies to 16 May 1830 had gone very badly for King Charles X.<ref>Guérard, ''France: A Modern History'' (1959) p. 287.</ref> In response, he tried repression but that only aggravated the crisis as suppressed deputies, gagged journalists, students from the University and many working men of Paris poured into the streets and erected barricades during the "three glorious days" (French ''Les Trois Glorieuses'') of 26–29 July 1830.  Charles X was deposed and replaced by Louis-Philippe of France|King Louis-Philippe in the July Revolution. It is traditionally regarded as a rising of the bourgeoisie against the absolute monarchy of the Bourbons. Participants in the July Revolution included Marie Joseph Paul Ives Roch Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette.  Working behind the scenes on behalf of the bourgeois propertied interests was Louis Adolphe Thiers.<ref>James Rule and Charles Tilly. "1830 and the Unnatural History of Revolution1."

Louis-Philippe's "July Monarchy" (1830–1848) was dominated by the ''haute bourgeoisie'' (high bourgeoisie) of bankers, financiers, industrialists and merchants.<ref>Paul Beik, ''Louis Philippe and the July Monarchy'' (1965).</ref>

During the reign of the July Monarchy, Romanticism|the Romantic Era was starting to bloom.<ref>Donald G. Charlton, ed., ''The French Romantics'' (1984).</ref> Driven by the Romantic Era, an atmosphere of protest and revolt was all around in France. On 22 November 1831 in Lyon (the second largest city in France) the silk workers revolted and took over the town hall in protest of recent salary reductions and working conditions. This was one of the first instances of a workers revolt in the entire world.<ref>Mary Lynn McDougall,  "Consciousness and Community: The Workers of Lyon, 1830–1850." ''Journal of Social History'' (1978) 12#1 pp. 129–145. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3787460 in JSTOR]</ref>

Because of the constant threats to the throne, the July Monarchy began to rule with a stronger and stronger hand. Soon political meetings were outlawed.  However, "banquets" were still legal and all through 1847, there was a nationwide campaign of republican banquets demanding more democracy. The climaxing banquet was scheduled for 22 February 1848 in Paris but the government banned it. In response citizens of all classes poured out onto the streets of Paris in a revolt against the July Monarchy. Demands were made for abdication of "Citizen King" Louis-Philippe and for establishment of a representative democracy in France.<ref>cite book|author=Maurice Agulhon|title=The Republican Experiment, 1848–1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9XFC28uLNIC&pg=PA23|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=23–40|isbn=9780521289887</ref>  The king abdicated, and the French Second Republic was proclaimed. Alphonse Marie Louis de Lamartine, who had been a leader of the moderate republicans in France during the 1840s, became the Minister of Foreign Affairs and in effect the premier in the new Provisional government.

File:Franz Xaver Winterhalter Napoleon III.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III, Emperor of the French. His very widespread popularity came from being the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte.
Frustration among the laboring classes arose when the Constituent Assembly did not address the concerns of the workers. Strikes and worker demonstrations became more common as the workers gave vent to these frustrations. These demonstrations reached a climax when on 15 May 1848, workers from the secret societies broke out in armed uprising against the anti-labor and anti-democratic policies being pursued by the Constituent Assembly and the Provisional Government. Fearful of a total breakdown of law and order, the Provisional Government invited General Louis Eugene Cavaignac back from Algeria, in June 1848, to put down the June Days Uprising|workers' armed revolt. From June 1848 until December 1848 General Cavaignac became head of the executive of the Provisional Government.<ref>William Fortescue, ''France and 1848: the end of monarchy'' (2005) p. 130</ref>

On 10 December 1848, Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was elected president by a landslide. His support came from a wide section of the French public. Various classes of French society voted for Louis Napoleon for very different and often contradictory reasons.<ref>Fortescue, ''France and 1848: the end of monarchy'' (2005) p. 135</ref>  Louis Napoleon himself encouraged this contradiction by "being all things to all people." One of his major promises to the peasantry and other groups was that there would be no new taxes.<ref name="B. Corley, 1961 pp. 74-77">T. A. B. Corley, ''Democratic Despot: A Life of Napoleon III'' (1961) pp. 74–77</ref>

The new National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly was heavily composed of royalist sympathizers of both the Legitimist (Bourbon) wing and the Orleanist (Citizen King Louis Philippe) wing. Because of the ambiguity surrounding Louis Napoleon's political positions, his agenda as president was very much in doubt. For prime minister, he selected Odilon Barrot, an unobjectionable middle-road parliamentarian who had led the "loyal opposition" under Louis Philippe. Other appointees represented various royalist factions.<ref name="B. Corley, 1961 pp. 74-77"/>

The Pope had been forced out of Rome as part of the Revolutions of 1848, and Louis Napoleon sent a 14,000-man expeditionary force of troops to the Papal State under General Charles Oudinot|Nicolas Charles Victor Oudinot to restore him. In late April 1849, it was defeated and pushed back from Rome by Giuseppe Garibaldi's volunteer corps, but then it recovered and recaptured Rome.<ref>Guérard, ''France: A Modern History'', p. 305.</ref>

In June 1849, demonstrations against the government broke out and were suppressed. The leaders, including prominent politicians, were arrested. The government banned several democratic and socialist newspapers in France; the editors were arrested. Karl Marx was at risk, so in August he moved to London.<ref>cite book|author=Maurice Agulhon|title=The Republican Experiment, 1848–1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9XFC28uLNIC&pg=PA23|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge U.P.  |pages=78–80|isbn=9780521289887</ref>

The government sought ways to balance its budget and reduce its debts. Toward this end, Hippolyte Passy was appointed Finance Minister.  When the Legislative Assembly met at the beginning of October 1849, Passy proposed an income tax to help balance the finances of France. The bourgeoisie, who would pay most of the tax, protested. The furor over the income tax caused the resignation of Barrot as prime minister, but a new wine tax also caused protests.<ref>cite book|author=Maurice Agulhon|title=The Republican Experiment, 1848–1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9XFC28uLNIC&pg=PA23|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|pages=117–38|isbn=9780521289887</ref>

The 1850 elections resulted in a conservative body. It passed the Falloux Laws, putting education into the hands of the Catholic clergy. It opened an era of cooperation between Church and state that lasted until the Jules Ferry laws reversed course in 1879. The Falloux Laws provided universal primary schooling in France and expanded opportunities for secondary schooling. In practice, the curricula were similar in Catholic and state schools. Catholic schools were especially useful in schooling for girls, which had long been neglected.<ref>Patrick J.

=Second Empire, 1852–1871=
The president rejected the constitution and made himself emperor as Napoleon III.  He is known for working to modernize the French economy, Haussmann's renovation of Paris|the rebuilding of Paris , expanding the overseas empire, and engaging in numerous wars.  His effort to build an empire in Mexico was a fiasco.  Autocratic at first, he opened the political system somewhat in the 1860s. He lost all his allies and recklessly declared war on a much more powerful Prussia in 1870; he was captured and deposed.

As 1851 opened, Louis Napoleon was not allowed by the Constitution of 1848 to seek re-election as President of France.<ref>Philip Guedalla, ''The Second Empire'' p. 203.</ref>  He proclaimed himself Emperor of the French in 1852, with almost dictatorial powers. He made completion of a good railway system a high priority. He consolidated three dozen small, incomplete lines into six major companies using Paris as a hub. Paris grew dramatically in terms of population, industry, finance, commercial activity, and tourism.  Napoleon working with Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Georges-Eugène Haussmann spent lavishly to rebuild the city into a world-class showpiece.<ref>David H. Pinkney, "Money and Politics in the Rebuilding of Paris, 1860–1870," ''Journal of Economic History'' (1957) 17#1 pp 45–61. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2114706 in JSTOR] </ref>  The financial soundness for all six companies was solidified by government guarantees. Although France had started late, by 1870 it had an excellent railway system, supported as well by good roads, canals and ports.<ref>J.H. Clapham, ''Economic development of France and Germany 1815-1914'' (1936) pp 147–150</ref>

Despite his promises in 1852 of a peaceful reign, the Emperor could not resist the temptations of glory in foreign affairs.  He was visionary, mysterious and secretive; he had a poor staff, and kept running afoul of his domestic supporters. In the end he was incompetent as a diplomat.<ref>Theodore Zeldin, ''France, 1848–1945: Ambition, love and politics'' (1973) pp 558–60</ref>  Napoleon did have some successes: he strengthened French control over Algeria, established bases in Africa, began the takeover of Indochina, and opened trade with China. He facilitated a French company building the Suez Canal, which Britain could not stop. In Europe, however, Napoleon failed again and again.  The Crimean war of 1854–56 produced no gains. Napoleon had long been an admirer of Italy and wanted to see it unified, although that might create a rival power. He plotted with Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour of Kingdom of Sardinia|the Italian kingdom of Piedmont to expel Austria and set up an Italian confederation of four new states headed by the pope. Second Italian War of Independence|Events in 1859 ran out of his control. Austria was quickly defeated, but instead of four new states a popular uprising united all of Italy under Piedmont. The pope held onto Rome only because Napoleon sent troops to protect him. His reward was the County of Nice (which included the city of Nice and the rugged Alpine territory to its north and east) and the Duchy of Savoy.  He angered Catholics when the pope lost most of his domains. Napoleon then reversed himself and angered both the anticlerical liberals at home and his erstwhile Italian allies when he protected the pope in Rome.

The British grew annoyed at Napoleon's humanitarian intervention in Syria in 1860–61.  Napoleon lowered the tariffs, which helped in the long run but in the short run angered owners of large estates and the textile and iron industrialists, while leading worried workers to organize. Matters grew worse in the 1860s as Napoleon nearly blundered into war with the United States in 1862, while his French intervention in Mexico|takeover of Mexico in 1861–67 was a total disaster. Maximilian I of Mexico|The puppet emperor he put on the Mexican throne was overthrown and executed.  Finally in the end he went to war with the Germans in 1870 when it was too late to stop German unification. Napoleon had alienated everyone; after failing to obtain an alliance with Austria and Italy, France had no allies and was bitterly divided at home. It was disastrously defeated on the battlefield, losing Alsace and Lorraine. A. J. P. Taylor is blunt: "he ruined France as a great power."<ref>John B.

Foreign wars
In 1854, The Second Empire joined the Crimean War, which saw France and Britain opposed to the Russian Empire, which was decisively defeated at Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|Sevastopol in 1854–55 and at Battle of Inkerman|Inkerman in 1854. In 1856 France joined the Second Opium War on the British side against China; a missionary's murder was used as a pretext to take interests in southwest Asia in the Treaty of Tientsin.

When France was negotiating with the Netherlands about purchasing Luxembourg in 1867, the Prussian Kingdom threatened the French government with war. This "Luxembourg Crisis" came as a shock to French diplomats as there had been an agreement between the Prussian and French governments about Luxembourg. Napoleon III suffered stronger and stronger criticism from Republicans like Jules Favre, and his position seemed more fragile with the passage of time.

France was looking for more interests in Asia. When French imperial ambitions revived, Africa and Indochina would be the main targets, and commercial incentives, which had driven the creation of the French colonial empire|pre-revolutionary empire, were secondary.<ref name="Doyle2001">cite book|author=William Doyle|title=The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEi4bYIUP1sC&pg=PT69|date=23 August 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-157837-3|pages=69–</ref> The country French Campaign against Korea, 1866|interfered in Korea in 1866 taking, once again, missionaries' murders as a pretext.

However, Tokugawa was defeated during the Boshin War at the Battle of Toba–Fushimi by large Imperial armies.

Such an event was more than France could possibly accept. Relations between France and Germany deteriorated, and finally the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) broke out.

=Modernisation and railways (1870–1914)=
main|History of rail transport in France
The seemingly timeless world of the French peasantry swiftly changed from 1870 to 1914. French peasants had been poor and locked into old traditions until railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription modernized rural France. The centralized government in Paris had the goal of creating a unified nation-state, so it required all students be taught standardized French. In the process, a new national identity was forged.<ref>Eugen Weber, ''Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France, 1890–1914'' (1976).</ref>

Railways became a national medium for the modernization of traditionalistic regions, and a leading advocate of this approach was the poet-politician Alphonse de Lamartine. In 1857 an army colonel hoped that railways might improve the lot of "populations two or three centuries behind their fellows" and eliminate "the savage instincts born of isolation and misery."<ref>cite book|author=Eugen Weber|title=Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France, 1870–1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4KnC4ROsiwwC&pg=PA4|year=1976|publisher=Stanford University Press|page=4|isbn=9780804710138</ref> Consequently, France built a centralized system that radiated from Paris (plus in the south some lines that cut east to west). This design was intended to achieve political and cultural goals rather than maximize efficiency. After some consolidation, six companies controlled monopolies of their regions, subject to close control by the government in terms of fares, finances, and even minute technical details.

The central government Corps of Bridges, Waters and Forests|department of Ponts et Chaussées (bridges and roads) brought in British engineers, handled much of the construction work, provided engineering expertise and planning, land acquisition, and construction of permanent infrastructure such as the track bed, bridges and tunnels. It also subsidized militarily necessary lines along the German border. Private operating companies provided management, hired labor, laid the tracks, and built and operated stations. They purchased and maintained the rolling stock—6,000 locomotives were in operation in 1880, which averaged 51,600 passengers a year or 21,200 tons of freight. Much of the equipment was imported from Britain and therefore did not stimulate machinery makers.

Although starting the whole system at once was politically expedient, it delayed completion, and forced even more reliance on temporary experts brought in from Britain. Financing was also a problem. The solution was a narrow base of funding through the Rothschilds and the closed circles of the Paris Bourse, so France did not develop the same kind of national stock exchange that flourished in London and New York. The system did help modernize the parts of rural France it reached, but it did not help create local industrial centers. Critics such as Émile Zola complained that it never overcame the corruption of the political system, but rather contributed to it.

The railways probably helped the industrial revolution in France by facilitating a national market for raw materials, wines, cheeses, and imported manufactured products. Yet the goals set by the French for their railway system were moralistic, political, and military rather than economic. As a result, the freight trains were shorter and less heavily loaded than those in such rapidly industrializing nations such as Britain, Belgium or Germany. Other infrastructure needs in rural France, such as better roads and canals, were neglected because of the expense of the railways, so it seems likely that there were net negative effects in areas not served by the trains.<ref>Patrick O'Brien, ''Railways and the Economic Development of Western Europe, 1830–1914'' (1983)</ref>

Third Republic and the Paris Commune
Following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck proposed harsh terms for peace — including the German occupation of the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine.<ref name=g326/> A new French National Assembly was elected to consider the German terms for peace. Elected on 8 February 1871, this new National Assembly was composed of 650 deputies.<ref name=g326/>

Sitting in Bordeaux, the French National Assembly established the French Third Republic|Third Republic. However, 400 members of the new Assembly were monarchists.<ref>William L. Shirer, ''The Collapse of the Third Republic'' Simon and Schuster: New York, 1969) p. 35.</ref> (Léon Gambetta was one of the "non-monarchist" Republicans that were elected to the new National Assembly from Paris.<ref>Guerard, ''France: A Modern History'' (1959)  p. 326.</ref>) On 16 February 1871, Adolphe Thiers was elected as the chief executive of the new Republic. Because of the revolutionary unrest in Paris, the centre of the Thiers government was located at Versailles (city)|Versailles.

File:Barricade18March1871.jpg|thumb|250px|A barricade in the Paris Commune, 18 March 1871.
In late 1870 to early 1871, the workers of Paris rose up in premature and unsuccessful small-scale uprisings.  The National Guard within Paris had become increasingly restive and defiant of the police, the army chief of staff, and even their own National Guard commanders. Thiers immediately recognized a revolutionary situation and, on 18 March 1871, sent regular army units to take control of artillery that belonged to the National Guard of Paris. Some soldiers of the regular army units fraternized with the rebels and the revolt escalated.<ref name="Eugene Schulkind pp. 22">Eugene Schulkind, ed. ''The Paris Commune 1871'' pp. 22–23.</ref>

The barricades went up just as in 1830 and 1848. The Paris Commune was born. Once again the ''Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville'', or Town Hall, became the center of attention for the people in revolt; this time the ''Hôtel de Ville'' became the seat of the revolutionary government. Other cities in France followed the example of the Paris Commune, as in Lyon, Marseille, and Toulouse. All of the Communes outside Paris were promptly crushed by the Thiers government.<ref name="Eugene Schulkind pp. 22"/>

An election on 26 March 1871 in Paris produced a government based on the working class.<ref>Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7AeNrR5AG0C&pg=PT85|title=Vital Democracy: A Theory of Democracy in Action|last=Hendriks|first=Frank|date=2010-04-08|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161439-2|language=en</ref>citation needed|date=May 2012 Louis Auguste Blanqui was in prison but a majority of delegates were his followers, called "Blanquists."citation needed|date=May 2012 The minority comprised anarchists and followers of Pierre Joseph Proudhon (1809–1855);citation needed|date=May 2012 as anarchists, the "Proudhonists" were supporters of limited or no government and wanted the revolution to follow an ''ad hoc'' course with little or no planning.citation needed|date=May 2012 Analysis of arrests records indicate the typical communard was opposed to the military, the clerics, the rural aristocrats.citation needed|date=May 2012 He saw the bourgeoisie as the enemy.citation needed|date=May 2012

After two months the French army moved in to retake Paris, with pitched battles fought in working-class neighbourhoods. Hundreds were executed in front of the Communards' Wall, while thousands of others were marched to Versailles for trials. The number killed during ''La Semaine Sanglante'' ("The Bloody Week" of 21–28 May 1871) was perhaps 30,000, with as many as 50,000 later executed or imprisoned; 7,000 were exiled to New Caledonia; thousands more escaped to exile.  The government won approval for its actions in a national referendum with 321,000 in favor and only 54,000 opposed.<ref>Patrick H. Hutton et al., eds.

Political battles
The Republican government next had to confront counterrevolutionaries who rejected the legacy of the 1789 Revolution. Both the Legitimists (embodied in the person of Henri, Count of Chambord, grandson of Charles X) and the Orleanist monarchist|royalists rejected republicanism, which they saw as an extension of modernity and atheism, breaking with France's traditions. This conflict became increasingly sharp in 1873, when Thiers himself was censured by the National Assembly as not being "sufficiently conservative" and resigned to make way for Marshal Patrice MacMahon as the new president.<ref>Guerard, ''France: A Modern History'' (1959), pp. 328–329</ref> Amidst the rumors of right-wing intrigue and/or coups by the Bonapartists or Bourbons in 1874, the National Assembly set about drawing up a new constitution that would be acceptable to all parties.

The new constitution provided for universal male suffrage and called for a bi-cameral legislature, consisting of a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies. The initial republic was in effect led by pro-royalists, but republicans (the "Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party (historical)|Radicals") and Bonapartism|Bonapartists scrambled for power. The first election under this new constitution – held in early 1876 – resulted in a republican victory, with 363 republicans elected as opposed to 180 monarchists.  However, 75 of the monarchists elected to the new Chamber of Deputies were Bonapartists.<ref name=sh39>William L. Shirer, ''The Collapse of the Third Republic'' p. 39.</ref>

The possibility of a coup d'état was an ever-present factor. Léon Gambetta chose moderate Armand Dufaure as premier but he failed to form a government.<ref name=sh39/> MacMahon next chose conservative Jules Simon. He too failed, setting the stage for the 16 May 1877 crisis, which led to the resignation of MacMahon.<ref>cite book|author=William Fortescue|title=The Third Republic in France, 1870–1940: Conflicts and Continuities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VzfBh4eQsPQC&pg=PA33|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415169455</ref> A restoration of the king now seemed likely, and royalists agreed on Henri, comte de Chambord, the grandson of Charles X. He insisted on an impossible demand and ruined the royalist cause. Its turn never came again as the Orleanist faction rallied themselves to the Republic, behind Adolphe Thiers. The new President of the Republic in 1879 was Jules Grevy. In January 1886, Georges Boulanger became Minister of War. Georges Clemanceau was instrumental in obtaining this appointment for Boulanger. This was the start of the Boulanger era and another time of threats of a coup.<ref>cite book|author=Arthur Augustus Tilley|title=Modern France: A Companion to French Studies|year=1967|publisher=CUP Archive|page=170|id=GGKEY:KFSQL2KCR5A</ref>

The Legitimist (Bourbon) faction mostly left politics but one segment founded ''L'Action Française'' in 1898, during the Dreyfus Affair; it became an influential movement throughout the 1930s, in particular among the conservative Catholic intellectuals.<ref>Eugen Weber, ''Action Française: Royalism and Reaction in Twentieth Century France'' (1962)</ref>


Solidarism and Radical Party 
While liberalism was individualistic and laissez-faire in Britain and the United States, in France liberalism was based instead on a solidaristic conception of society, following the theme of the French Revolution, ''Liberté, égalité, fraternité'' ("liberty, equality, fraternity").  In the Third Republic, especially between 1895 and 1914  “Solidarité” ["solidarism"] was the guiding concept of a liberal social policy, whose chief champions were the prime ministers Leon Bourgeois (1895-96) and Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau  (1899-1902)<ref>cite book|author=Jack Hayward|title=Fragmented France: Two Centuries of Disputed Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZgSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA44|year=2007|publisher=Oxford UP|page=44|isbn=9780199216314</ref> 

The period from 1879 to 1914 saw power mostly in the hands of moderate republicans and "radicals"; they avoided state ownership of industry and had a middle class political base. Their main policies were  governmental intervention (financed by a progressive income tax) to provide a social safety net. They opposed church schools. They expanded educational opportunities and promoted consumers' and producers' cooperatives. In terms of foreign policy they supported the League of Nations, compulsory arbitration, controlled disarmament, and economic sanctions to keep the peace.<ref>Jack Ernest S.

Foreign policy
main|History of French foreign relations
French foreign policy from 1871 to 1914 showed a dramatic transformation from a humiliated power with no friends and not much of an empire in 1871, to the centerpiece of the European alliance system in 1914, with a flourishing empire that was second in size only to Great Britain. Although religion was a hotly contested matter and domestic politics, the Catholic Church made missionary work and church building a specialty in the colonies. Most Frenchman ignored foreign policy; its issues were a low priority in politics.<ref>Gordon right, ''France in Modern Times'' (5th ed 1995) pp 288–99.</ref>

French foreign policy was based on a fear of Germany—whose larger size and fast-growing economy could not be matched—combined with a revanchism that demanded the return of Alsace and Lorraine. At the same time, in the midst of the Scramble for Africa, French and British interest in Africa came into conflict. The most dangerous episode was the Fashoda Incident of 1898 when French troops tried to claim an area in the Southern Sudan, and a British force purporting to be acting in the interests of the Khedive of Egypt arrived. Under heavy pressure the French withdrew securing Anglo-Egyptian control over the area. The status quo was recognised by an agreement between the two states acknowledging British control over Egypt, while France became the dominant power in Morocco, but France suffered a humiliating defeat overall.<ref>D.W. Brogan, ''France under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870–1930)'' (1940) pp 321–26</ref>

The Suez Canal, initially built by the French, became a joint British-French project in 1875, as both saw it as vital to maintaining their influence and empires in Asia.  In 1882, ongoing civil disturbances in Egypt prompted Britain to intervene, extending a hand to France. France's leading expansionist Jules Ferry was out of office, and the government allowed Britain to take effective control of Egypt.<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848–1918'' (1954) pp 286–92</ref>

France had colonies in Asia and looked for alliances and found in Japan a possible ally. During his visit to France, Iwakura Tomomi asked for French assistance in reforming Japan. French military missions were sent to Japan in French military mission to Japan (1872–80)|1872–80, in French military mission to Japan (1884–89)|1884–89 and the last one much later in French military mission to Japan (1918–19)|1918–19 to help modernize the Japanese army.  Conflicts between the Chinese Emperor and the French Republic over Indochina climaxed during the Sino-French War (1884–85). Amédée Courbet|Admiral Courbet destroyed the Chinese fleet anchored at Battle of Foochow|Foochow. The treaty ending the war, put France in a protectorate over northern and central Vietnam, which it divided into Tonkin and Annam (French colony)|Annam.<ref name=wak>Frederic Wakeman, Jr., ''The Fall of Imperial China'' (1975) pp. 189–191.</ref>

In an effort to isolate Germany, France went to great pains to woo Russia and Great Britain, first by means of the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894, then the 1904 Entente Cordiale with Great Britain, and finally the Anglo-Russian Entente in 1907, which became the Triple Entente. This alliance with Britain and Russia against Germany and Austria eventually led Russia and Britain to enter World War I as France's Allies.<ref>Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848–1918'' (1954) pp 345, 403–26</ref>

Dreyfus Affair
Distrust of Germany, faith in the army, and native French anti-semitism combined to make the Dreyfus Affair (the unjust trial and condemnation of a Jewish military officer for "treason" in 1894) a political scandal of the utmost gravity. For a decade, the nation was divided between "dreyfusards" and "anti-dreyfusards", and far-right Catholic agitators inflamed the situation even when proofs of Dreyfus's innocence came to light. The writer Émile Zola published an impassioned editorial on the injustice (''J'Accuse…!'') and was himself condemned by the government for libel. Dreyfus was finally pardoned in 1906. The upshot was a weakening of the conservative element in politics.  Moderates were deeply divided over the Dreyfus Affair, and this allowed the Radical Party (France)|Radicals to hold power from 1899 until World War I. During this period, crises like the threatened  "Boulangist" coup d'état (1889) showed the fragility of the republic.<ref>Piers Paul Read, ''The Dreyfus Affair: The Scandal That Tore France in Two'' (2012)</ref>

Religion 1870–1924
Main|Religion in France# History
Throughout the lifetime of the Third Republic there were battles over the status of the Catholic Church. The French clergy and bishops were closely associated with the Monarchists and many of its hierarchy were from noble families. Republicans were based in the anticlerical middle class who saw the Church's alliance with the monarchists as a political threat to republicanism, and a threat to the modern spirit of progress. The Republicans detested the church for its political and class affiliations; for them, the church represented outmoded traditions, superstition and monarchism. The Republicans were strengthened by Protestant and Jewish support. Numerous laws were passed to weaken the Catholic Church. In 1879, priests were excluded from the administrative committees of hospitals and of boards of charity. In 1880, new measures were directed against the religious congregations. From 1880 to 1890 came the substitution of lay women for nuns in many hospitals. Napoleon's 1801 Concordat continued in operation but in 1881, the government cut off salaries to priests it disliked.<ref>Philippe Rigoulot, "Protestants and the French nation under the Third Republic: Between recognition and assimilation," ''National Identities,'' March 2009, Vol. 11 Issue 1, pp 45–57</ref>

When Leo XIII became pope in 1878 he tried to calm Church-State relations. In 1884 he told French bishops not to act in a hostile manner to the State. In 1892 he issued an encyclical advising French Catholics to rally to the Republic and defend the Church by participating in Republican politics. This attempt at improving the relationship failed.<ref>Frank Tallett and Nicholas Atkin, ''Religion, society, and politics in France since 1789'' (1991) p. 152</ref>

Deep-rooted suspicions remained on both sides and were inflamed by the Dreyfus Affair. Catholics were for the most part anti-dreyfusard. The Assumptionists published anti-Semitic and anti-republican articles in their journal ''La Croix''. This infuriated Republican politicians, who were eager to take revenge. Often they worked in alliance with Masonic lodges. The Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau|Waldeck-Rousseau Ministry (1899–1902) and the Émile Combes|Combes Ministry (1902–05) fought with the Vatican over the appointment of bishops.  Chaplains were removed from naval and military hospitals (1903–04), and soldiers were ordered not to frequent Catholic clubs (1904). Combes as Prime Minister in 1902, was determined to thoroughly defeat Catholicism. He closed down all parochial schools in France. Then he had parliament reject authorisation of all religious orders. This meant that all fifty four orders were dissolved and about 20,000 members immediately left France, many for Spain.<ref>Tallett and Atkin, ''Religion, society, and politics in France since 1789'' (1991) pp 152ff</ref>

In 1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|1905 the 1801 Concordat was abrogated; Church and State were separated.  All Church property was confiscated. Public worship was given over to associations of Catholic laymen who controlled access to churches.  In practise, Masses and rituals continued.  The Church was badly hurt and lost half its priests.  In the long run, however, it gained autonomy—for the State no longer had a voice in choosing bishops and Gallicanism was dead.<ref>Robert Gildea, ''Children of the Revolution: The French, 1799–1914'' (2010)  ch 12</ref>  Conservative Catholics regain control of Parliament In  1919 and reversed most of the penalties imposed on the Church, and gave bishops back control of church lands and buildings.

"The Re-establishment of Relations between France and the Vatican in 1921." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 2.4 (1967): 163-182.</ref>   However, the long-term secularization of French society continued, as most people only attended ceremonies for such major events as birth, marriage and funerals.<ref>Jean-Marie Mayeur and Madeleine Rebérioux, ''The Third Republic from its Origins to the Great War, 1871–1914'' (1984) pp 227–44.</ref>

''Belle époque''
The end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century was the ''Belle Époque'' because of peace, prosperity and the cultural innovations of Monet, Bernhardt, and Debussy,  and popular amusements – cabaret, can-can, the film|cinema,<ref>Charles Rearick, ''Pleasures of the Belle Epoque: Entertainment and Festivity in Turn-of-the-Century France'' (1988)</ref>  new art forms such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau.<ref>Mary McAuliffe, ''Dawn of the Belle Epoque: The Paris of Monet, Zola, Bernhardt, Eiffel, Debussy, Clemenceau, and Their Friends'' (2011)</ref>

In 1889 the Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle showed off newly modernised Paris to the world, which could look over it all from atop the new Eiffel Tower. Meant to last only a few decades, the tower was never removed and became France's most iconic landmark.<ref>cite book|author1=Lucien Hervé|author2=Barry Bergdoll|title=The Eiffel Tower|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XJvlC5e8Hb8C&pg=PA16|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|page=16</ref>

France was nevertheless a nation divided internally on notions of ideology, religion, class, regionalisms, and money. On the international front, France came repeatedly to the brink of war with the other imperial powers, such as the 1898 Fashoda Incident with Great Britain over East Africa.

Colonial Empire
Main|French colonial empire|Evolution of the French Empire
File:French Empire 17th century-20th century.png|thumb|450px|Dark blue = second empire 1830-1960

The second colonial empire constituted the overseas colonies, protectorates and League of Nations mandate|mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the "first colonial empire", that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost, and the "second colonial empire", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. The second colonial empire came to an end after the loss in later wars First Indochina War|of Vietnam (1954) and Algerian War|Algeria (1962), and relatively peaceful Decolonisation of Africa|decolonizations elsewhere after 1960.<ref>Robert Aldrich, ''Greater France: A History of French Overseas Expansion'' (1996)</ref>

France lost wars to Britain that stripped away nearly all of its colonies by 1765. France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850, concentrating chiefly French African colonies|in Africa as well as French Indochina|Indochina and the South Pacific. Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany after 1880 started to build German colonial empire|their own colonial empire. As it developed, the new empire took on roles of trade with France, especially supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading French civilization and language and the Catholic religion. It also provided manpower in the World Wars.<ref>cite book|author=Tony Chafer|title=The End of Empire in French West Africa: France's Successful Decolonization?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GseKljgaW0C&pg=PA84|year=2002|publisher=Berg|pages=84–85|isbn=9781859735572</ref>

It became a moral mission to lift the world up to French standards by bringing Christianity and French culture. In 1884, the leading proponent of colonialism, Jules Ferry, declared; "The higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a Civilizing mission|duty to civilize the inferior races." Full citizenship rights – ''assimilation'' – were offered. In reality the French settlers were given full rights and the natives given very limited rights.  Apart from Algeria few settlers permanently settled in its the colonies. Even in  Algeria, the "Pied-Noir" (French settlers) always remained a small minority.<ref>Martin Evans, ''Empire and culture: the French experience, 1830-1940'' (2004).</ref>

At its apex, it was one of the List of largest empires|largest empires in history. Including metropolitan France, the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached convert|11500000|km2|sqmi|-5|abbr=on in 1920, with a population of 110 million people in 1939. In World War II, Charles de Gaulle and the Free French used the overseas colonies as bases from which they fought to liberate France. Historian Tony Chafer argues: "In an effort to restore its world-power status after the humiliation of defeat and occupation, France was eager to maintain its overseas empire at the end of the Second World War."<ref>Tony Chafer, ''The end of empire in French West Africa: France's successful decolonisation?'' (2002) [http://eprints.port.ac.uk/3567/ abstract]</ref> However, after 1945 Anti-colonial liberation movements|anti-colonial movements successfully challenged European authority. The French constitution of 27 October 1946 (Fourth Republic), established the French Union which endured until 1958. Newer remnants of the colonial empire were integrated into France as Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments and territories within the French Republic. These now total about 1% of the pre-1939 colonial area, with 2.7 million people living in them in 2013. By the 1970s, says Robert Aldrich (historian)|Robert Aldrich, the last "vestiges of empire held little interest for the French." He argues, "Except for the traumatic decolonization of Algeria, however, what is remarkable is how few long-lasting effects on France the giving up of empire entailed."<ref>Robert Aldrich, ''Greater France: A History of French Overseas Expansion'' (1996) p 305.

The population held steady from 40.7 million in 1911, to 41.5 million in 1936.

File:El 114 de infantería, en París, el 14 de julio de 1917, León Gimpel.jpg|thumb|The 114th infantry in Paris, 14 July 1917.

France did not expect war in 1914, but when it came in August the entire nation rallied enthusiastically for two years.  It specialized in sending infantry forward again and again, only to be stopped again and again by German artillery, trenches, barbed wire and machine guns, with horrific casualty rates.  Despite the loss of major industrial districts France produced an enormous output of munitions that armed both the French and the American armies.  By 1917 the infantry was on the verge of mutiny, with a widespread sense that it was now the American turn to storm the German lines.  But they rallied and defeated the greatest German offensive, which came in spring 1918, then rolled over the collapsing invaders. November 1918 brought a surge of pride and unity, and an unrestrained demand for revenge.

Preoccupied with internal problems, France paid little attention to foreign policy in the 1911–14 period, although it did extend military service to three years from two over strong Socialist objections in 1913. The rapidly escalating July Crisis|Balkan crisis of 1914 caught France unaware, and it played only a small role in Causes of World War I|the coming of World War I.<ref>Joachim Remak,  "1914--The Third Balkan War: Origins Reconsidered." ''Journal of Modern History'' 43.3 (1971): 354-366 at pp 354-55.</ref>  The Serbian crisis triggered a complex set of military alliances between European states, causing most of the continent, including France, to be drawn into war within a few short weeks. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia in late July, triggering Russian mobilization. On 1 August both Germany and France ordered mobilization. Germany was much better prepared militarily than any of the other countries involved, including France.  The German Empire, as an ally of Austria, declared war on Russia. France was allied with Russia and so was ready to commit to war against the German Empire.  On 3 August Germany declared war on France, and sent its armies through neutral Belgium. Britain entered the war on 4 August, and started sending in troops on 7 August.  Italy, although tied to Germany, remained neutral and then joined the Allies in 1915.

Schlieffen Plan|Germany's "Schlieffen Plan" was to quickly defeat the French. They captured city of Brussels|Brussels, Belgium by 20 August and soon had captured a large portion of northern France. The original plan was to continue southwest and attack Paris from the west. By early September they were within Convert|65|km|mi of Paris, and the French government had relocated to Bordeaux. The Allies finally stopped the advance northeast of Paris at the First Battle of the Marne|Marne River (5–12 September 1914).<ref>cite book|author=Holger H. Herwig|title=The Marne, 1914: The Opening of World War I and the Battle That Changed the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIYgL6NKyMwC&pg=PA40|year=2011|publisher=Random House|pages=266–306|isbn=9780812978292</ref>

The war now became a stalemate — the famous "Western Front (World War I)|Western Front" was fought largely in France and was characterized by very little movement despite extremely large and violent battles, often with new and more destructive military technology. On the Western Front the small improvised trenches of the first few months rapidly grew deeper and more complex, gradually becoming vast areas of interlocking defensive works. The land war quickly became dominated by the muddy, bloody stalemate of Trench warfare, a form of war in which both opposing armies had static lines of defense.  The war of movement quickly turned into a war of position. Neither side advanced much, but both sides suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. German and Allied armies produced essentially a matched pair of trench lines from the Swiss border in the south to the North Sea coast of Belgium. Meanwhile, large swaths of northeastern France came under the brutal control of German occupiers.<ref>Helen McPhail, ''The Long Silence: The Tragedy of Occupied France in World War I'' (IB Tauris, 2014)</ref>

Trench warfare prevailed on the Western Front from September 1914 until March 1918.  Famous battles in France include Battle of Verdun (spanning 10 months from 21 February to 18 December 1916), Battle of the Somme (1 July to 18 November 1916), and five separate conflicts called the Battle of Ypres (from 1914 to 1918).

After Socialist leader Jean Jaurès. a pacifist, was assassinated at the start of the war, the French socialist movement abandoned its antimilitarist positions and joined the national war effort.  Prime Minister Rene Viviani  called for unity—for a "Union sacrée" ("Sacred Union")--Which was a wartime truce between the right and left factions that had been fighting bitterly. France had few dissenters. However, war-weariness was a major factor by 1917, even reaching the army. The soldiers were reluctant to attack; Mutiny was a factor as soldiers said it was best to wait for the arrival of millions of Americans. The soldiers were protesting not just the futility of frontal assaults in the face of German machine guns but also degraded conditions at the front lines and at home, especially infrequent leaves, poor food, the use of African and Asian colonials on the home front, and concerns about the welfare of their wives and children.<ref>Leonard V. Smith, "War and 'Politics': The French Army Mutinies of 1917," ''War in History,'' (April 1995) 2#2 pp 180–201</ref>

After defeating Russia in 1917, Germany now could concentrate on the Western Front, and planned an all-out assault in the spring of 1918, but had to do it before the very rapidly growing American army played a role. In March 1918 Germany launched its offensive and by May had reached the Marne and was again close to Paris. However, in the Second Battle of the Marne (15 July to 6 August 1918), the Allied line held.  The Allies then shifted to the offensive.<ref>Michael S. Neiberg, ''The Second Battle of the Marne'' (Indiana UP, 2008)</ref>  The Germans, out of reinforcements, were overwhelmed day after day and the high command saw it was hopeless. Austria and Turkey collapsed, and the Kaiser's government fell. Germany signed "Armistice with Germany|The Armistice" that ended the fighting effective 11 November 1918, "the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month."<ref>Harry Rudin, ''Armistice, 1918'' (Yale UP, 1944).</ref>

=Wartime losses=
The war was fought in large part on French soil, with 1.4&nbsp;million French dead including civilians, and four times as many military casualties.  The economy was hurt by the German invasion of major industrial areas in the northeast.  While the occupied area in 1913 contained only 14% of France's industrial workers, it produced 58% of the steel, and 40% of the coal.<ref>Gerd Hardach, ''The First World War: 1914–1918'' (1977) pp 87–88</ref><ref>McPhail, ''The Long Silence: The Tragedy of Occupied France in World War I'' (IB Tauris, 2014)</ref>  In 1914 the government implemented a war economy with controls and rationing. By 1915 the war economy went into high gear, as millions of French women and colonial men replaced the civilian roles of many of the 3 million soldiers.  Considerable assistance came with the influx of American food, money and raw materials in 1917. This war economy would have important reverberations after the war, as it would be a first breach of liberal theories of non-interventionism.<ref>Pierre-Cyrille Hautcoeur, "Was the Great War a watershed? The economics of World War I in France," in Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch 6</ref> The damages caused by the war amounted to about 113% of the GDP of 1913, chiefly the destruction of productive capital and housing. The national debt rose from 66% of GDP in 1913 to 170% in 1919, reflecting the heavy use of bond issues to pay for the war.  Inflation was severe, with the franc losing over half its value against the British pound.<ref>Paul Beaudry and Franck Portier, "The French depression in the 1930s." ''Review of Economic Dynamics''(2002) 5#1 pp. 73–99.</ref>

The richest families were hurt, as the top 1 percent saw their share of wealth drop from about 60% in 1914 to 36% in 1935, then plunge to 20 percent in 1970 to the present.  A great deal of physical and financial damage was done during the world wars, foreign investments were cashed in to pay for the wars, the Russian Bolsheviks expropriated large-scale investments, postwar inflation demolished cash holdings, stocks and bonds plunged during the Great Depression, and progressive taxes ate away at accumulated wealth. <ref>Piketty, ''Capital in the Twenty-First Century'' (2014) pp 339-45.Piketty, ''Top Incomes in France in the Twentieth Century: Inequality and Redistribution, 1901–1998'' (2018) pp 101-48, 468-477.</ref>

From 1925 until his death in 1932, Aristide Briand, as prime minister during five short intervals, directed French foreign policy, using his diplomatic skills and sense of timing to forge friendly relations with Weimar Germany as the basis of a genuine peace within the framework of the League of Nations. He realized France could neither contain the much larger Germany by itself nor secure effective support from Britain or the League.<ref>Eugen Weber, ''The Hollow Years: France in the 1930s'' (1996) p. 125</ref>

As a response to the failure of the Weimar Republic to pay reparations in the aftermath of World War I, France occupied the industrial region of the Ruhr as a means of ensuring repayments from Germany. The intervention was a failure, and France accepted the American solution to the reparations issues, as expressed in the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan.

In the 1920s, France established an elaborate system of border defences called the Maginot Line, designed to fight off any German attack. (Unfortunately, the Maginot Line did not extend into Belgium, where Germany attacked in 1940.) Military alliances were signed with weak powers in 1920–21, called the "Little Entente".

Great Depression

By contrast to the mild economic upheaval, the political upheaval was enormous.  Socialist Leon Blum, leading the Popular Front (France)|Popular Front, brought together Socialists and Radicals to become Prime Minister from 1936 to 1937; he was the first Jew and the first Socialist to lead France.<ref>Pierre Birnbaum, ''Léon Blum: Prime Minister, Socialist, Zionist'' (2015)</ref> The Communists in the Chamber of Deputies (parliament) voted to keep the government in power, and generally supported the government's economic policies, but rejected its foreign policies.  The Popular Front passed numerous labor reforms, which increased wages, cut working hours to 40 hours with overtime illegal and provided many lesser benefits to the working class such as mandatory two-week paid vacations. However, renewed inflation canceled the gains in wage rates, unemployment did not fall, and economic recovery was very slow.  Historians agree that the Popular Front was a failure in terms of economics, foreign policy, and long-term stability.  "Disappointment and failure," says Jackson, "was the legacy of the Popular Front."<ref>Julian Jackson, ''Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy 1934–1938'' (1988), pp 172, 215, 278–87, quotation on page 287.</ref><ref>Douglas Johnson, "Léon Blum and the Popular Front," ''History'' (1970) 55#184 pp 199–206.</ref><ref>cite book|author1=Philippe Bernard |author2=Henri Dubief |title=The Decline of the Third Republic, 1914–1938|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xFLMJnHQaGwC&pg=PA328|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=328|isbn=9780521358545 </ref> There is general agreement that at first the Popular Front created enormous excitement and expectations on the left—including very large scale sitdown strikes—but in the end it failed to live up to its promise.

Foreign policy
The government joined Britain in establishing an arms embargo during the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). Blum rejected support for the Spanish Republicans because of his fear that civil war might spread to deeply divided France. Financial support in military cooperation with Poland was also a policy. The government nationalized arms suppliers, and dramatically increased its program of rearming the French military in a last-minute catch up with the Germans.<ref>Maurice Larkin, ''France since the Popular Front: Government and People, 1936–1986'' (1988) pp 45–62</ref>

Appeasement of Germany, in cooperation with Britain,  was the policy after 1936, as France sought peace even in the face of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's escalating demands.

Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939 finally caused France and Britain to declare war against Germany. But the Allies did not launch massive assaults and instead kept a defensive stance: this was called the Phoney War in Britain or ''Drôle de guerre'' – the funny sort of war – in France. It did not prevent the German army from conquering Poland in a matter of weeks with its innovative Blitzkrieg tactics, also helped by the Soviet Union's attack on Poland.

When Germany had its hands free for an attack in the west, the Battle of France began in May 1940, and the same Blitzkrieg tactics proved just as devastating there. The Wehrmacht bypassed the Maginot Line by marching through the Ardennes forest. A second German force was sent into Belgium and the Netherlands to act as a diversion to this main thrust. In six weeks of savage fighting the French lost 90,000 men.<ref>Joel Blatt (ed), ''The French Defeat of 1940'' (Oxford, 1998)</ref><ref>Robert A. Doughty, ''The Breaking Point: Sedan and the Fall of France, 1940'' (2014)</ref>

Many civilians sought refuge by taking to the roads of France: some 2 million refugees from Belgium and the Netherlands were joined by between 8 and 10 million French civilians, representing a quarter of the French population, all heading south and west. This movement may well have been the largest single movement of civilians in history prior to 1947.

Paris fell to the Germans on 14 June 1940, but not before the British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from Dunkirk, along with many French soldiers.

Vichy France was established on 10 July 1940 to govern the unoccupied part of France and its colonies. It was led by Philippe Pétain, the aging war hero of the First World War.  Petain's representatives signed a harsh Armistice of 22 June 1940|Armistice on 22 June 1940 whereby Germany kept most of the French army in camps in Germany, and France had to pay out large sums in gold and food supplies.  Germany occupied three-fifths of France's territory, leaving the rest in the southeast to the new Vichy France|Vichy government. However, in practice, most local government was handled by the traditional French officialdom. In November 1942 all of Vichy France was finally occupied by German forces.  Vichy continued in existence but it was closely supervised by the Germans.<ref>Robert O.

The Vichy regime sought to collaborate with Germany, keeping peace in France to avoid further occupation although at the expense of personal freedom and individual safety. Some 76,000 Jews were deported during the German occupation, often with the help of the Vichy authorities, and murdered in the Nazis' extermination camps.<ref>Michael Marrus, ''Vichy France and the Jews'' (Stanford University Press, 1995)</ref>

Resistance
General Charles de Gaulle in London declared himself on BBC radio to be the head of a rival government in exile, and gathered the Free French Forces around him, finding support in some French colonies and recognition from Britain but not the United States. After the Attack on Mers-el-Kébir in 1940, where the British fleet destroyed a large part of the French navy, still under command of Vichy France, that killed about 1,100 sailors, there was nationwide indignation and a feeling of distrust in the French forces, leading to the events of the Battle of Dakar. Eventually, several important French ships joined the Free French Forces.<ref>Thomas Martin, "After Mers-el-Kébir: The Armed Neutrality of the Vichy French Navy, 1940–43."

Within France proper, the organized underground grew as the Vichy regime resorted to more strident policies in order to fulfill the enormous demands of the Nazis and the eventual decline of Nazi Germany became more obvious. They formed French Resistance|the Resistance.<ref>H. R. Kedward, ''In Search of the Maquis'' (Oxford, 1993)</ref> The most famous figure of the French resistance was Jean Moulin, sent in France by de Gaulle in order to link all resistance movements; he was captured and tortured by Klaus Barbie (the "butcher of Lyon"). Increasing repression culminated in the complete destruction and extermination of the village of Oradour-sur-Glane at the height of the Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy. At 2.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 10 June 1944, a company of the 2nd SS Panzer Division, ‘Das Reich’, entered Oradour-sur-Glane. They herded most of its population into barns, garages and the church, and then massacred 642 men, women and children, all of whom were civilians. 

In 1953, 21 men went on trial in Bordeaux for the Oradour killings. Fourteen of the accused proved to be French citizens of Alsace. Following convictions, all but one were pardoned by the French government.

The French army recruited French Forces of the Interior (de Gaulle's formal name for resistance fighters) to continue the war until the final defeat of Germany; this army numbered 300,000 men by September 1944 and 370,000 by spring 1945.<ref>Arthur Funk, ''Charles de Gaulle: the crucial years, 1943–1944'' (1959).</ref>

The Vichy regime disintegrated. An interim Provisional Government of the French Republic was quickly put into place by de Gaulle.  The ''gouvernement provisoire de la République française'', or GPRF, operated under a ''tripartisme'' alliance of communists, socialists, and democratic republicans. The GPRF governed France from 1944 to 1946, when it was replaced by the French Fourth Republic. Tens of thousands of collaborators were executed without trial.  The new government declared the Vichy laws unconstitutional and illegal, and elected new local governments. Women gained the right to vote.

The 2 million French soldiers held as POWs and forced laborers in Germany throughout the war were not at risk of death in combat, but the anxieties of separation for their 800,000 wives were high. The government provided a modest allowance, but one in ten became prostitutes to support their families. It gave women a key symbolic role to carry out the national regeneration. It used propaganda, women's organizations, and legislation to promote maternity, patriotic duty, and female submission to marriage, home, and children's education.<ref>Hanna Diamond, ''Women and the Second World War in France 1939–1948: Choices and Constraints'' (1999)</ref>  Conditions were very difficult for housewives, as food was short as well as most necessities.

The political scene in 1944–45 was controlled by the Resistance, but it had numerous factions. Charles de Gaulle and the Free France element had been based outside France, but now came to dominate, in alliance with the Socialists, the Christian Democrats (MRP), and what remained of the Radical party. The Communists had largely dominated the Resistance inside France, but cooperated closely with the government in 1944–45, on orders from the Kremlin. There was a general consensus that important powers that had been an open collaboration with the Germans should be nationalized, such as Renault automobiles and the History of French journalism|major newspapers. A new Social Security system was called for, as well as important new concessions to the labor unions.

= Economic recovery =
Wartime damage to the economy was severe, and apart from gold reserves, France had inadequate resources  to recover on its own. The transportation system was in total shambles – the Allies had bombed out the railways and the bridges, and the Germans had destroyed the port facilities. Energy was an extremely short supply, with very low stocks of coal and oil.  Imports of raw material were largely cut off, so most factories had shut down. The invaders had stripped most of the  valuable industrial tools for German factories.  Discussions with the United States for emergency aid dragged on, with repeated postponements on both sides. Meanwhile, several million French prisoners of war and forced laborers were being returned home, with few jobs and little food available for them. The plan was for 20 percent of German reparations to be paid to France, but Germany was in much worse shape even in France, and in no position to pay.<ref>Hilary Footitt and John Simmonds, ''France, 1943-1945'' (1988) pp 215-27.</ref>  

After de Gaulle left office in January 1946, the diplomatic logjam was broken in terms of American aid.  Lend Lease had barely restarted When it was unexpectedly handed in August 1945. The U.S.  Army shipped in food, 1944-46. U.S. Treasury loans and cash grants were given in 1945-47, and especially the Marshall Plan gave large sums (1948-51). There was post-Marshall aid (1951-55) designed to help France rearm and provide massive support for its war in Indochina. Apart from low-interest loans, the other funds were grants that did not involve repayment.  The debts left over from World War I, whose payment had been suspended since 1931, was renegotiated in the Blum-Byrnes agreement of 1946. The United States forgave all $2.8 billion in debt from the First World War, and gave France a new loan of $650 million. In return French negotiator Jean Monnet set out the French five-year plan for recovery and development.<ref>cite book|author=Irwin M.

A central feature of the Marshall Plan was to encourage international trade, reduce tariffs, lower barriers, and modernize French management. The Marshall Plan set up intensive tours of American industry.  France sent 500 missions with 4700 businessmen and experts to tour American factories, farms, stores and offices.  They were especially impressed with the prosperity of American workers, and how they could purchase an inexpensive new automobile for nine months work, compared to 30 months in France.<ref>Richard, F. Kuisel, ''Seducing the French: The Dilemma of Americanization'' (1993) pp 70 – 102.</ref> Some French businesses resisted Americanization, but the most profitable, especially  chemicals, oil, electronics, and instrumentation, seized upon the opportunity to attract American investments and build a larger market.  <ref>Laureen Kuo, "Improving French Competitiveness through American Investment following World War II."

Although the economic situation in France was grim in 1945, resources did exist and the economy regained normal growth by the 1950s.<ref>Claude Fohlen, "France, 1920–1970" in Carlo M. Cipolla, ed. ''The Fontana Economic History of Europe: Vol.6 Part 1: Contemporary Economies, part 1'' (1976) pp 72–127.</ref>  France managed to regain its international status thanks to a successful production strategy, a demographic spurt, and technical and political innovations. Conditions varied from firm to firm. Some had been destroyed or damaged, nationalized or requisitioned, but the majority carried on, sometimes working harder and more efficiently than before the war. Industries were reorganized on a basis that ranged from consensual (electricity) to conflictual (machine tools), therefore producing uneven results. Despite strong American pressure through the ERP, there was little change in the organization and content of the training for French industrial managers. This was mainly due to the reticence of the existing institutions and the struggle among different economic and political interest groups for control over efforts to improve the further training of practitioners.<ref>John S. Hill, "American Efforts to Aid French Reconstruction Between Lend-Lease and the Marshall Plan." ''Journal of Modern History'' 1992 64(3): 500–524.  [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2124596 in jstor]</ref>

The Monnet Plan provided a coherent framework for economic policy, and it was strongly supported by the Marshall Plan. It was inspired by moderate, Keynesian free-trade ideas rather than state control. Although relaunched in an original way, the French economy was about as productive as comparable West European countries.<ref>Philippe Mioche, "Le Demarrage de l'economie Française au lendemain de la Guerre," [Restarting the French Economy after the War].

Claude Fohlen argues that:
: in all then, France received 7000 million dollars, which were used either to finance the imports needed to get the economy off the ground again or to implement the Monnet Plan....Without the Marshall Plan, however, the economic recovery would have been a much slower process – particularly in France, where American aid provided funds for the Monnet Plan and thereby restored equilibrium in the equipment industries, which govern the recovery of consumption, and opened the way... To continuing further growth.  This growth was affected by a third factor... decolonization.<ref>Claude Fohlen, "France" pp 102–3.</ref>

Algeria was no mere colony.

In 1956 another crisis struck French colonies, this time in Egypt. The Suez Canal, having been built by the French government, belonged to the French Republic and was operated by the Suez Canal Company|Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez. Great Britain had bought the Egyptian share from Isma'il Pasha and was the second largest owner of the canal before the crisis.

The Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the canal despite French and British opposition; he determined that a European response was unlikely. Great Britain and France attacked Egypt and built an alliance with Israel against Nasser. Israel attacked from the east, Britain from Cyprus and France from Algeria. Egypt, the most powerful Arab state of the time, was defeated in a mere few days.  The Suez crisis caused an outcry of indignation in the entire Arab world and Saudi Arabia set an embargo on oil on France and Britain. The US President Dwight D. Eisenhower forced a ceasefire; Britain and Israel soon withdrew, leaving France alone in Egypt. Under strong international pressures, the French government ultimately evacuated its troops from Suez and largely disengaged from the Middle East.<ref>Anthony Gorst and Lewis Johnman, ''The Suez Crisis'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>

He managed to keep France together while taking steps to end the war, much to the anger of the Pieds-Noirs (Frenchmen settled in Algeria) and the military; both had supported his return to power to maintain colonial rule.

Terrorism grew worse. In 1994 Air France Flight 8969 was hijacked by Islamic terrorists; they were captured.

Conservative Jacques Chirac assumed office as president on 17 May 1995, after a campaign focused on the need to combat France's stubbornly high unemployment rate. While France continues to revere its rich history and independence, French leaders increasingly tie the future of France to the continued development of the European Union. In 1992 France ratified the Maastricht Treaty establishing the European Union. In 1999, the Euro was introduced to replace the French franc. Beyond membership in the European Union, France is also involved in many joint European projects such as Airbus, the Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system and the Eurocorps.

The French have stood among the strongest supporters of NATO and EU policy in the Balkans to prevent genocide in Yugoslavia.

Sophie Meunier in 2017 ponders whether France is still relevant in world affairs:
:France does not have as much relative global clout as it used to. Decolonization ... diminished France’s territorial holdings and therefore its influence. Other countries acquired nuclear weapons and built up their armies. The message of “universal” values carried by French foreign policy has encountered much resistance, as other countries have developed following a different political trajectory than the one preached by France. By the 1990s, the country had become, in the words of Stanley Hoffmann, an “ordinary power, neither a basket case nor a challenger.” Public opinion, especially in the United States, no longer sees France as an essential power. The last time that its foreign policy put France back in the world spotlight was at the outset of the Iraq intervention...[with] France’s refusal to join the US-led coalition....In reality, however, France is still a highly relevant power in world affairs....France is a country of major military importance nowadays...., France also showed it mattered in world environmental affairs with....the Paris Agreement, a global accord to reduce carbon emissions. The election of Trump in 2016 may reinforce demands for France to step in and lead global environmental governance if the US disengages, as the new president has promised, from a variety of policies.<ref>Sophie Meunier,  "Is France Still Relevant?."

Schneider says:

<blockquote>For the next three convulsive weeks, riots spread from suburb to suburb, affecting more than three hundred towns....Nine thousand vehicles were torched, hundreds of public and commercial buildings destroyed, four thousand rioters arrested, and 125 police officers wounded.<ref name=schneider>Cathy Lisa Schneider, "Police Power and Race Riots in Paris," ''Politics & Society'' (2008) 36#1 pp 133–159 on p. 136</ref></blockquote>

In March 2012, a Muslim radical named Toulouse and Montauban shootings|Mohammed Merah shot three French soldiers and four Jewish citizens, including children in Toulouse and Montauban.

World leaders rally to Paris to show their support for free speech.  Analysts agree that the episode had a profound impact on France.  ''The New York Times'' summarized the ongoing debate:

<blockquote>So as France grieves, it is also faced with profound questions about its future: How large is the radicalized part of the country's Muslim population, the largest in Europe? How deep is the rift between France's values of secularism, of individual, sexual and religious freedom, of freedom of the press and the freedom to shock, and a growing Muslim conservatism that rejects many of these values in the name of religion?<ref>Steven Erlangerjan, "Days of Sirens, Fear and Blood: ‘France Is Turned Upside Down’", [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/10/world/days-of-sirens-fear-and-blood-france-is-turned-upside-down.html ''New York Times'' Jan 9, 2015]</ref></blockquote>clear left
