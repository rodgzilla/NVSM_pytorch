File:Earth's atmosphere.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The interface between the Earth's surface and outer space. The Kármán line at an altitude of convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on is shown. The layers of atmosphere of Earth|the atmosphere are drawn to scale, whereas objects within them, such as the International Space Station, are not.

Outer space, or just space, is the expanse that exists beyond the Earth and outside of any astronomical object. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma (physics)|plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, cosmic neutrino background|neutrinos, cosmic dust|dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature, as set by the cosmic background radiation|background radiation from the Big Bang, is Convert|2.7|K|C F|abbr=out.<ref name="CBE2008" /> The Warm–hot intergalactic medium|plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the baryonic matter|baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe; it has a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins;<ref name=baas41_908/> local concentrations of this plasma have condensed into stars and galaxy|galaxies. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces.sfn|Freedman|Kaufmann|2005|pp=573, 599–601<ref name="Trimble 1987" /> Observations suggest that the majority of the Mass–energy equivalence|mass-energy in the observable universe is a poorly understood vacuum energy of space, which astronomers label ''dark energy''.<ref name="nasa_darkenergy" />sfn|Freedman|Kaufmann|2005|pp=650–653 Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.

Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth's surface. However, the Kármán line, an altitude of Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on above sea level,sfn|O'Leary|2009|p=84<ref name=space_begin/> is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely space exploration|explore outer space. Despite the drafting of UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space, anti-satellite weapons have been tested in Earth orbit.

Humans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the advent of high-altitude Balloon (aircraft)|balloon flights, followed by manned rocket launches. Earth orbit was first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961, and unmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the Solar System. Due to the high cost of getting into space, manned spaceflight has been limited to low Earth orbit and the Moon.

Outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the hazards of vacuum and radiation. Microgravity also has a negative effect on human physiology that causes both muscle atrophy and Spaceflight osteopenia|bone loss. In addition to these health and environmental issues, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high.

 Discovery 
In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle suggested that ''nature abhors a vacuum'', a principle that became known as the ''Horror vacui (physics)|horror vacui''. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE Ontology|ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space.sfn|Grant|1981|p=10 Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the Western culture|West it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty.sfn|Porter|Park|Daston|2006|p=27 As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled.sfn|Eckert|2006|p=5

In ancient China, the 2nd-century astronomer Zhang Heng became convinced that space must be infinite, extending well beyond the mechanism that supported the Sun and the stars. The surviving books of the Hsüan Yeh school said that the heavens were boundless, "empty and void of substance". Likewise, the "sun, moon, and the company of stars float in the empty space, moving or standing still".sfn|Needham|Ronan|1985|pp=82–87

The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei knew that air had mass and so was subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted the formation of a vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil Evangelista Torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician Blaise Pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air, then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower.sfn|Holton|Brush|2001|pp=267–268 In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the Puy de Dôme mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.sfn|Cajori|1917|pp=64–66

In 1650, German scientist Otto von Guericke constructed the first vacuum pump: a device that would further refute the principle of ''horror vacui''. He correctly noted that the atmosphere of the Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the density gradually declining with altitude. He concluded that there must be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.sfn|Genz|2001|pp=127–128

Back in the 15th century, German theologian Nicolaus Cusanus speculated that the Universe lacked a center and a circumference. He believed that the Universe, while not infinite, could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained.sfn|Tassoul|Tassoul|2004|p=22 These ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican heliocentric cosmology to the concept of an infinite Universe filled with a substance he called Aether (classical element)|aether, which did not resist the motion of heavenly bodies.sfn|Gatti|2002|pp=99–104 English philosopher William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void.sfn|Kelly|1965|pp=97–107 This concept of an aether originated with ancient Greece|ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies move.sfn|Olenick|Apostol|Goodstein|1986|p=356

The concept of a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether remained in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate.sfn|Hariharan|2003|p=2 In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking for changes in the speed of light depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference.sfn|Olenick|Apostol|Goodstein|1986|pp=357–365sfn|Thagard|1992|pp=206–209

The first professional astronomer to support the concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman Thomas Digges in 1576.sfn|Maor|1991|p=195 But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel. He showed that the star 61 Cygni had a stellar parallax|parallax of just 0.31&nbsp;arcseconds (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years.sfn|Webb|1999|pp=71–73 In 1917, Heber Doust Curtis|Heber Curtis noted that novae in spiral nebulae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than galactic novae, suggesting that the former are 100 times further away.<ref name=Curtis1988/> The distance to the Andromeda Galaxy was determined in 1923 by American astronomer Edwin Hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by Henrietta Leavitt.<ref name=csiro_20041025/> This established that the Andromeda galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the Milky Way.sfn|Tyson|Goldsmith|2004|pp=114–115

The modern concept of outer space is based on the Big Bang cosmology|"Big Bang" cosmology, first proposed in 1931 by the Belgian physicist Georges Lemaître.<ref name=nature127_3210_706/> This theory holds that the universe originated from a very dense form that has since undergone continuous Hubble's law|expansion.

The earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the Swiss physicist Charles Édouard Guillaume|Charles É. Guillaume in 1896. Using the estimated radiation of the background stars, he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5–6&nbsp;K. British physicist Arthur Eddington made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3.18&nbsp;K in 1926. German physicist Erich Regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8&nbsp;K in 1933.<ref name="Apeiron2_3_79"/> American physicists Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman predicted 5&nbsp;K for the temperature of space in 1948, based on the gradual decrease in background energy following the then-new Big Bang theory.<ref name="Apeiron2_3_79"/> The modern measurement of the cosmic microwave background is about 2.7K.

The term ''outward space'' was used in 1842 by the English poet Lady Emmeline Stuart-Wortley in her poem "The Maiden of Moscow".sfn|Stuart Wortley|1841|p=410 The expression ''outer space'' was used as an astronomical term by Alexander von Humboldt in 1845.sfn|Von Humboldt|1845|p=39 It was later popularized in the writings of H. G. Wells in 1901.<ref name="entymonline"/> The shorter term ''space'' is older, first used to mean the region beyond Earth's sky in John Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' in 1667.<ref name=harper2001/>

 Formation and state 
File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|This is an artist's concept of the metric expansion of space, where a volume of the Universe is represented at each time interval by the circular sections. At left is depicted the rapid Inflationary epoch|inflation from the initial state, followed thereafter by steady expansion to the present day, shown at right.
Main|Big Bang
According to the Big Bang theory, the very early Universe was an extremely hot and dense state about age of the universe|13.8&nbsp;billion years ago<ref name=planck_2013 /> which rapidly Metric expansion of space|expanded. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called Recombination (cosmology)|recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space.<ref name="SciAm301_1_36"/> Matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxy|galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space.sfn|Silk|2000|pp=105–308 As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe.<ref name="SciAm301_1_36"/> This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.

The present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic microwave background using satellites like the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. These observations indicate that the spatial geometry of the observable universe is "Flatness (cosmology)|flat", meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe, except for local gravity.<ref name="WMAP"/> The flat Universe, combined with the measured mass density of the Universe and the accelerating Hubble's law|expansion of the Universe, indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy, which is called dark energy.sfn|Sparke|Gallagher|2007|pp=329–330

Estimates put the average energy density of the present day Universe at the equivalent of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters.<ref name=nasa_wmap/> The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast Void (astronomy)|voids that have much lower density, at least in terms of visible matter.<ref name=aj89_1461/> Unlike matter and dark matter, dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.<ref name=rvmphys_75_559 />

 Environment 
File:Hubble Ultra Deep Field part d.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Part of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field image showing a typical section of space containing galaxies interspersed by deep vacuum. Given the finite speed of light, this view covers the past nowrap|13&nbsp;billion years of the Chronology of the universe|history of outer space.|alt=A black background with luminous shapes of various sizes scattered randomly about. They typically have white, red or blue hues.
Outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets, and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits, following the Planetary formation|initial formation stage. However, even the deep vacuum of Outer space#Intergalactic|intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter.<ref name=pasj20_230/> By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 10<sup>25</sup> molecules per cubic meter.sfn|Borowitz|Beiser|1971<ref name=patrick/> The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 10<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;km, or 10&nbsp;billion light years.sfn|Davies|1977|p=93 In spite of this, Extinction (astronomy)|extinction, which is the Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.<ref name=fitzpatrick2004/>

Stars, planets, and moons retain their atmospheres by gravitational attraction. Atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary: the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space.sfn|Chamberlain|1978|p=2 The Earth's atmospheric pressure drops to about nowrap|0.032 Pascal (unit)|Pa at Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off of altitude,<ref name=squire2000/> compared to 100,000 Pa for the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) definition of Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard pressure. Above this altitude, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the Sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind. The thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to space weather.<ref name=jmsj_85B_193/>

The temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic theory of gases|kinetic activity of the gas, as it is on Earth. However, the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas, meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium.sfn|Prialnik|2000|pp=195–196sfn|Spitzer|1978|p=28–30 All of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the Big Bang, which is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). (There is quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos called the cosmic neutrino background.<ref name="fp2_30"/>) The current black body temperature of the background radiation is about convert|3|K|C F|0|lk=on.<ref name=apj707_2_916/> The gas temperatures in outer space are always at least the temperature of the CMB but can be much higher. For example, the corona of the Sun reaches temperatures over 1.2–2.6&nbsp;million&nbsp;K.<ref name=apj325_442/>

Magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10&nbsp;μGauss (unit)|G. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated Cosmic dust|dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical Polarization (waves)|polarization. This has been used to show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magnetohydrodynamics|Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in Active galactic nucleus|active Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic Astrophysical jet|jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal Astronomical radio source|radio sources have been detected even among the most distant, redshift|high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.<ref name=WielebinskiBeck2010/>

Outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field, there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Electronvolt|eV up to an extreme 10<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;eV of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.<ref name=rmp83_3_907/> The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of electrons is only about 1% of that of protons.sfn|Lang|1999|p=462 Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a Health threat from cosmic rays|health threat to space travelers.sfn|Lide|1993|p=11hyphen217<!-- Note: this is not a page range --> According to astronauts, like Don Pettit, space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an arc welding torch.<ref name=ls2012/><ref name="PopSicSmell"/>

Despite the harsh environment, several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007.<ref name="Astrobiology_11_4_281"/> Seeds of ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and ''Nicotiana tabacum'' germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years.<ref name="Astrobiology_12_5_517"/> A strain of ''bacillus subtilis'' has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment.<ref name="Astrobiology_12_5_498"/> The Panspermia|lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the Solar System, with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.<ref name="Nicholson2010"/>

Even at relatively low altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere, conditions are hostile to the human body. The altitude where atmospheric pressure matches the vapor pressure of water at the Human body temperature|temperature of the human body is called the Armstrong line, named after American physician Harry G. Armstrong. It is located at an altitude of around convert|19.14|km|mi|abbr=on. At or above the Armstrong line, fluids in the throat and lungs boil away. More specifically, exposed bodily liquids such as saliva, tears, and liquids in the lungs boil away. Hence, at this altitude, human survival requires a pressure suit, or a pressurized capsule.sfn|Piantadosi|2003|pp=188–189

Once in space, sudden exposure of unprotected humans to very low Atmospheric pressure|pressure, such as during a rapid decompression, can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs, due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest.<ref name=ajeas2_4_573/> Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture.<ref name=krebs_pilmanis1996/> Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia.<ref name=ajeas2_4_573/>

As a consequence of rapid decompression, oxygen dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the partial pressure gradient. Once the deoxygenated blood arrives at the brain, humans lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes.<ref name=bmj286/> Blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6.3&nbsp;kPa, and this condition is called ebullism.<ref name=jramc157_1_85/> The steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels, so some blood remains liquid.sfn|Billings|1973|pp=1–34<ref name=landis20070807/> Swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a pressure suit. The Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS), a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts, prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa.<ref name=am39_376/> Supplemental oxygen is needed at Convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on to provide enough oxygen for breathing and to prevent water loss, while above Convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on pressure suits are essential to prevent ebullism.sfn|Ellery|2000|p=68 Most space suits use around 30–39&nbsp;kPa of pure oxygen, about the same as on the Earth's surface. This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism, but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause decompression sickness and air embolism|gas embolisms if not managed.sfn|Davis|Johnson|Stepanek|2008|pp=270–271

Human evolution|Humans evolved for life in Earth Gravitation|gravity, and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, Vertigo (medical)|vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the Human skeleton|skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise.<ref name=spp22_15/> Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.<ref name=cmaj180_13_1317/>

For long-duration space travel, radiation can pose an acute health hazard.
Exposure to high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the Human eye|eyes, nervous system, Human lung|lungs and the Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract.<ref name=nsbri_radiation/> On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, a large fraction of the cells in an astronaut's body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei.<ref name=curtis_and_Letaw/> The energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research is needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.<ref name=sas4_11_1013/>

There is no clear boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space, as the density of the atmosphere gradually decreases as the altitude increases. There are several standard boundary designations, namely:
* The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale has established the Kármán line at an altitude of convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics. This is used because at an altitude of about Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on, as Theodore von Kármán calculated, a vehicle would have to travel faster than Orbital speed|orbital velocity to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift from the atmosphere to support itself.sfn|O'Leary|2009|p=84<ref name=space_begin/>
* The United States designates people who travel above an altitude of convert|50|mi|km as astronauts.sfn|Wong|Fergusson|2010|p=16
* NASA's Space Shuttle used 400,000 feet (76&nbsp;mi, 122&nbsp;km) as its atmospheric reentry|re-entry altitude (termed the Entry Interface), which roughly marks the boundary where atmospheric drag becomes noticeable, thus beginning the process of switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with aerodynamic control surfaces.<ref name=petty20030213/>

In 2009, scientists reported detailed measurements with a Supra-Thermal Ion Imager (an instrument that measures the direction and speed of ions), which allowed them to establish a boundary at Convert|118|km|mi|abbr=on above Earth. The boundary represents the midpoint of a gradual transition over tens of kilometers from the relatively gentle winds of the Earth's atmosphere to the more violent flows of charged particles in space, which can reach speeds well over Convert|268|m/s|mph|abbr=on.<ref name=thompton20090409/><ref name=jgr114/>

The Outer Space Treaty provides the basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states, and includes in its definition of ''outer space'' the Moon and other celestial bodies. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national sovereignty. It also prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in outer space. The treaty was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of 2017, 105 state parties have either ratified or acceded to the treaty. An additional 25 states signed the treaty, without ratifying it.<ref name="unoosa2" /><ref name=unoosa/>

Since 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple United Nations resolutions. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space.<ref name=garros/> Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China.sfn|Wong|Fergusson|2010|p=4 The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.<ref name=esf20071105/>

In 1976, eight equatorial states (Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Republic of the Congo|Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire, Uganda, Kenya, and Indonesia) met in Bogotá, Colombia. With their "Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries", or "the Bogotá Declaration", they claimed control of the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country.<ref name=bogota1976/> These claims are not internationally accepted.<ref name=aasl31_2006/>

 Earth orbit 
main|Geocentric orbit
A spacecraft enters orbit when its Centripetal force|centripetal acceleration due to Gravitation|gravity is less than or equal to the centrifugal force|centrifugal acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity. For a low Earth orbit, this velocity is about Convert|7800|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on;<ref name=hill1999/> by contrast, the fastest manned airplane speed ever achieved (excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft) was Convert|2200|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on in 1967 by the North American X-15.<ref name=shiner20071101/>

To achieve an orbit, a spacecraft must travel faster than a sub-orbital spaceflight. The energy required to reach Earth orbital velocity at an altitude of Convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on is about 36&nbsp;Megajoule|MJ/kg, which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude.<ref name=dimotakis1999/> Spacecraft with a Apsis|perigee below about Convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on are subject to drag from the Earth's atmosphere,sfn|Ghosh|2000|pp=47–48 which decreases the orbital altitude. The rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite's cross-sectional area and mass, as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere. Below about Convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on, decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days. Once a satellite descends to Convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on, it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere.<ref name=slsa/> The escape velocity required to pull free of Earth's gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about Convert|11200|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on.<ref name=williams2010/>

 Regions 
Space is a partial vacuum: its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and "winds" that dominate within them, and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond. Geospace extends from Earth's atmosphere to the outer reaches of Earth's magnetic field, whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space.sfn|Schrijver|Siscoe|2010|p=363 Interplanetary space extends to the heliopause, whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the interstellar medium.<ref name=universetoday_interplanetaryspace /> Interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy, where it fades into the intergalactic void.<ref name=jpl_interstellarspace />

wikt:geospace|Geospace is the region of outer space near Earth, including the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere.sfn|Schrijver|Siscoe|2010|p=363 The Van Allen radiation belts lie within the geospace. The outer boundary of geospace is the magnetopause, which forms an interface between the Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind. The inner boundary is the ionosphere.<ref name=geospace/> The variable space-weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the Sun and the solar wind; the subject of geospace is interlinked with heliophysics—the study of the Sun and its impact on the planets of the Solar System.sfn|Fichtner|Liu|2011|pp=341–345

The day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressure—the subsolar distance from the center of the Earth is typically 10 Earth radii. On the night side, the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a magnetotail that sometimes extends out to more than 100–200 Earth radii.sfn|Koskinen|2010|pp=32, 42<ref name=HonesJr1986/> For roughly four days of each month, the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the Moon passes through the magnetotail.sfn|Mendillo|2000|p=275

Geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities, the motions of which are controlled by the Earth's magnetic field. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. Geomagnetic storms can disturb two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, interfering with shortwave radio communication and Global Positioning System|GPS location and timing.<ref>cite book |title=Space Weather & Telecommunications |first=John M. |last=Goodman |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4465qvHUZusC&pg=PA244|isbn=978-0-387-23671-1|page=244</ref> Magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit.

The region of space where Earth's gravity remains dominant against gravitational perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations from the Sun is called the Hill sphere.<ref name=yoder1995/> This extends well out into translunar space to a distance of roughly 1% of the mean distance from Earth to the Sun,sfn|Barbieri|2006|p=253 or convert|1.5|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit.

Nebulous material streams away to the top and left, slowly fading with distance.
Interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere (the heliosphere) for billions of kilometers into space. This wind has a particle density of 5–10 protons/cm<sup>3</sup> and is moving at a velocity of Convert|350|-|400|km/s|mph|abbr=on.sfn|Papagiannis|1972|pp=12–149 Interplanetary space extends out to the Astropause|heliopause where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the Sun.<ref name=universetoday_interplanetaryspace /> The distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind.<ref name=phillips2009/> The heliopause in turn deflects away low-energy galactic cosmic rays, with this modulation effect peaking during solar maximum.<ref name=Kohler2017/>

The volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum, with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the Earth. However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is also gas, Plasma (physics)|plasma and dust, small meteors, and several dozen types of organic chemistry|organic molecules discovered to date by rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy.<ref name=asp2003/> A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light.<ref name="leinert_grun_1990"/>

Interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the Sun.sfn|Papagiannis|1972|pp=12–149 There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of charged particles such as the Van Allen radiation belts. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.<ref name=ssr69_3_215/>

Interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma.<ref name=jpl_interstellarspace /> The contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium. Approximately 70% of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis. These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula.<ref name="Ferrière2001"/> The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova generates an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials that further enrich the medium.<ref name="witt2001"/> The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: the average is around 10<sup>6</sup> particles per m<sup>3</sup>,<ref name=Boulares1990/> but cold molecular clouds can hold 10<sup>8</sup>–10<sup>12</sup> per m<sup>3</sup>.sfn|Prialnik|2000|pp=195–196<ref name="Ferrière2001"/>

A List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|number of molecules exist in interstellar space, as can tiny 0.1&nbsp;Micrometre|μm dust particles.sfn|Rauchfuss|2008|pp=72–81 The tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing at the rate of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the trihydrogen cation. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions.<ref name="PNAS103_33_12232"/>

The local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100&nbsp;parsecs (pc) of the Sun, which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the Solar System. This volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the Local Bubble, which is characterized by a lack of dense, cold clouds. It forms a cavity in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders, such as those in the constellations of Ophiuchus and Taurus (constellation)|Taurus. (The actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250&nbsp;pc or more.) This volume contains about 10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>5</sup> stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the Stellar-wind bubble|astrospheres that surround these stars, with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium. The Local Bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000&nbsp;K and radii of 0.5–5&nbsp;pc.<ref name=redfield2006/>

When stars are moving at sufficiently high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades it was assumed that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer|Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager program|Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a Mach number|subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium.<ref name=bow_science/><ref name=bow/> A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the Heliosphere#Termination shock|termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).<ref name=bow/>

Intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies. Studies of the large scale distribution of galaxies show that the Universe has a foam-like structure, with Galaxy groups and clusters|clusters and groups of galaxies lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space. The remainder forms huge voids that are mostly empty of galaxies. Typically, a Void (astronomy)|void spans a distance of (10–40) ''h''<sup>−1</sup> Mpc, where ''h'' is the Hubble constant in units of nowrap|100 km s<sup>−1</sup> Mpc<sup>−1</sup>.sfn|Wszolek|2013|p=67

Surrounding and stretching between galaxies, there is a rarefaction|rarefied plasma<ref name=jafelice_opher1992/> that is organized in a galaxy filament|galactic filamentary structure.<ref name=wadsley2002/> This material is called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The density of the IGM is 5–200 times the average density of the Universe.<ref name="apj_714_1715"/> It consists mostly of ionized hydrogen; i.e. a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons. As gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids, it heats up to temperatures of 10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;K to 10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;K,<ref name=baas41_908/> which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons to escape from the hydrogen nuclei; this is why the IGM is ionized. At these temperatures, it is called the warm–hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). (Although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards, 10<sup>5</sup> K is often called "warm" in astrophysics.) Computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the Universe might exist in this warm–hot, rarefied state.<ref name="apj_714_1715" /><ref name=ssr134_1_141/><ref name="apjs_182_378"/> When gas falls from the filamentary structures of the WHIM into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments, it can heat up even more, reaching temperatures of 10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;K and above in the so-called intracluster medium.<ref name="apj546_100"/>

Brown areas of ground are visible in some areas through openings in the swirling white clouds. The lower left of the disk is in partial shadow.

For the majority of human history, space was explored by observations made from the Earth's surface—initially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope. Prior to the advent of reliable rocket technology, the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through the use of balloon flights. In 1935, the U.S. ''Explorer II'' manned balloon flight had reached an altitude of Convert|22|km|mi|abbr=on.<ref name=ssr13_2_199/> This was greatly exceeded in 1942 when the third launch of the German V-2 rocket|A-4 rocket climbed to an altitude of about Convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on. In 1957, the unmanned satellite ''Sputnik 1'' was launched by a Russian R-7 Semyorka|R-7 rocket, achieving Earth orbit at an altitude of Convert|215|-|939|km|mi.sfn|O'Leary|2009|pp=209–224 This was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin was sent into orbit on Vostok 1. The first humans to escape low-Earth orbit were Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders in 1968 on board the U.S. Apollo 8, which achieved lunar orbitsfn|Harrison|2002|pp=60–63 and reached a maximum distance of Convert|377349|km|mi|abbr=on from the Earth.sfn|Orloff|2001

The first spacecraft to reach escape velocity was the Soviet Luna 1, which performed a fly-by of the Moon in 1959.sfn|Hardesty|Eisman|Krushchev|2008|pp=89–90 In 1961, Venera 1 became the first planetary probe. It revealed the presence of the solar wind and performed the first fly-by of Venus, although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the 1962 fly-by of Venus by Mariner 2.sfn|Collins|2007|p=86 The first fly-by of Mars was by Mariner 4 in 1964. Since that time, unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System's planets, as well their moons and many minor planets and comets. They remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space, as well as observation of the Earth.sfn|Harris|2008|pp=7, 68–69 In August 2012, Voyager 1 became the first man-made object to leave the Solar System and enter interstellar space.<ref name="mike_wall"/>

The absence of air makes outer space an ideal location for astronomy at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is evidenced by the spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13&nbsp;billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed.<ref name=hubblesite_cosmicdawn /> However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The Interplanetary dust cloud|interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust increases its effectiveness.<ref name=esa105/> Likewise, a site like the Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater on the far side of the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the Electromagnetic interference|radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.<ref name=maccone2001/>

Unmanned spacecraft in Earth orbit are an essential technology of modern civilization. They allow direct monitoring of Weather satellite|weather conditions, relay Communications satellite|long-range communications like television, provide a means of Satellite navigation|precise navigation, and allow remote sensing of the Earth. The latter role serves a wide variety of purposes, including tracking soil moisture for agriculture, prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs, detection of diseases in plants and trees, and Spy satellite|surveillance of military activities.sfn|Razani|2012|pp=97–99

The deep vacuum of space could make it an attractive environment for certain industrial processes, such as those requiring ultraclean surfaces.<ref name=chapman1991/> However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires significant investment with little prospect of immediate return.<ref name="IJA10_307"/> An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: $Inflation|US|6000|2006|r=-3|fmt=c–Inflation|US|20000|2006|r=-3|fmt=c per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate.<ref name="jsr43_3_696"/> Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.sfn|Bolonkin|2010|p=xv

Interstellar travel for a human crew remains at present only a theoretical possibility. The distances to the nearest stars will require new technological developments and the ability to safely sustain crews for journeys lasting several decades. For example, the Daedalus Project study, which proposed a spacecraft powered by the nuclear fusion|fusion of Deuterium and Helium-3|He<sup>3</sup>, would require 36 years to reach the nearby Alpha Centauri system. Other proposed interstellar propulsion systems include light sails, Bussard ramjet|ramjets, and beam-powered propulsion. More advanced propulsion systems could use antimatter as a fuel, potentially reaching Relativistic speed|relativistic velocities.<ref name=Crawford1990/>
