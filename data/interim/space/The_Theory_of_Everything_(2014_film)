Plot 
At the University of Cambridge, astrophysics student Stephen Hawking begins a romantic relationship with literature student Jane Hawking | Jane Wilde. Although Stephen excels at mathematics and physics, his friends and professors are concerned over his lack of a thesis topic. After Stephen and his professor Dennis W. Sciama|Dennis Sciama attend a lecture on black holes, Stephen speculates that black holes may have been part of the creation of the universe, and decides to write his thesis on time.

While pursuing his research, Stephen's muscles begin to fail, eventually causing him to fall and hit his head. He learns he has Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|motor neurone disease; he will be unable to talk, swallow, breathe, or move most of his body; and has approximately two years to live. Stephen asks what will happen to his brain. The doctor tells Stephen that the disease will not affect it or his thoughts, but that eventually, no one will know what they are. As Stephen becomes reclusive, focusing on his work, Jane confesses she loves him. She tells Stephen's father she intends to stay with Stephen even as his condition worsens. They marry and have a son.

Stephen presents his thesis to the examination board, arguing that a black hole created the universe in a Big Bang, that it will emit Hawking radiation|heat, and that it will end in a Big Crunch. While celebrating with Jane and his friends, Stephen realises he cannot walk, and begins using a wheelchair.
                
After having a second child, a daughter, Stephen develops a theory about the visibility of black holes, and becomes a world-renowned physicist. Jane, focusing on the children and on Stephen's health and increasing fame, is unable to work on her own thesis and becomes frustrated. Stephen tells her he will understand if she needs help. She joins the church choir, where she meets widower Jonathan and they become close friends. She employs him as a piano teacher for her son and Jonathan befriends the entire family, helping Stephen with his illness, supporting Jane, and playing with the children.

When Jane gives birth to another son, Stephen's mother asks Jane if the baby is Jonathan's, which she denies. Jane sees that Jonathan overheard the conversation, and is appalled, but when they are alone, they admit their feelings for one another. Jonathan stays away from the family, but Stephen visits him, saying that Jane needs him.

While Jane and Jonathan take the children camping, Stephen is invited to attend an opera performance in Bordeaux, and contracts pneumonia. While in the hospital, the doctors tell Jane that Stephen needs a tracheotomy, which will leave him unable to speak. She agrees to the surgery.

Stephen learns to use a partner-assisted scanning|spelling board, and uses it to communicate with Elaine, his new nurse.  He receives a computer with a built-in speech synthesis|voice synthesiser, and uses it to write a book, ''A Brief History of Time'', which becomes an international best-seller.

Stephen tells Jane that he has been invited to America to accept an award, and will be taking Elaine with him. Jane faces the realisation that her and Stephen's marriage has not been working, telling him she "did her best". Jane and Stephen agree to divorce. Stephen goes to the lecture with Elaine, the two having fallen in love, and Jane and Jonathan reunite. At the lecture, Stephen sees a student drop a pen; he imagines getting up to return it, almost crying at the reminder of how his disease has affected him. He goes on to give an inspiring speech, saying, "There should be no boundaries to human endeavour. We are all different.  However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at.  While there's life, there is hope".

Stephen invites Jane to meet Queen Elizabeth II with him to receive his Order of the Companions of Honour; they share a happy day together with their children, with Stephen saying "Look what we made".

An extended closing series comprises select moments from the film; shown in reverse, back to the moment Stephen first saw Jane. A final title sequence brings the lives of the lead characters up to date. Jane and Jonathan are happily married, and she has completed her PhD. She and Stephen remain close friends. Stephen declines a knighthood from the Queen and continues his research, with no plans to retire.

Screenwriter Anthony McCarten had been interested in Hawking since reading his seminal book ''A Brief History of Time'' in 1988. In 2004, McCarten read Jane Hawking's memoir ''Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen'', and subsequently began writing a screenplay adaptation of the book, with no guarantees in place. He met numerous times with Jane at her home to discuss the project.  After multiple drafts, he was introduced in 2009 to producer Lisa Bruce via their mutual ICM agent, Craig Bernstein.<ref>cite web|last=Levy|first=Emmanuel|title=Theory of Everything: making movie about Stephen Hawkings|url=http://EmanuelLevy.com/pick-of-the-week/theory-of-everything-making-the-movie-about-stephen-hawkings|date=5 September 2014|website=EmanuelLevy.com|publisher=Emmanuel Levy|accessdate=16 September 2014</ref>

Bruce spent three years with McCarten, further convincing Jane Hawking to agree to a film adaptation of her book, with Bruce stating, "It was a lot of conversation, many glasses of sherry, and many pots of tea".<ref>cite news|title=Toronto: THR Honors 'Theory of Everything' stars and director with breakthrough in film awards|url=http://www.HollywoodReporter.com/news/toronto-thr-honors-theory-everything-730776|date=7 September 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=7 September 2014</ref> On 18 April 2013, James Marsh (director)|James Marsh was confirmed to direct the film, with the shooting being based in Cambridge, and at other locations in the United Kingdom,citation needed|date=May 2015|reason=Guardian article cited at end of sentence does not confirm Marsh as director.

Marsh had studied archival images to give the film its authenticity, stating, "When we had photographs and documentary footage of Stephen that related to our story, we tried to reproduce them as best we could".<ref name=InsideMovies>cite web|title=Eddie Redmayne on playing (and meeting) Stephen Hawking|url=http://InsideMovies.ew.com/2014/08/18/the-theory-of-everything-eddie-redmayne-talks-playing-and-meeting-stephen-hawking/|date=18 August 2014 |website=InsideMovies.ew.com|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=18 August 2014</ref> Redmayne met with Stephen Hawking|Hawking himself, commenting, "Even now, when he's unable to move, you can still see such effervescence in his eyes". And described portraying Hawking on-screen as a "hefty" challenge, adding that, "The real problem with making a film is of course you don't shoot chronologically. So it was about having to really try and chart his physical deterioration [so] you can jump into it day-to-day, whilst at the same time keeping this spark and wit and humour that he has".<ref name=InsideMovies/>

Redmayne spent six months researching Hawking's life, watching every piece of interview footage he could find of him.<ref name=VarietyCry>cite news |title=Toronto: 'The Theory of Everything' made Stephen Hawking cry|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/toronto-the-theory-of-everything-made-stephen-hawking-cry-1201300436/|date=7 September 2014|website=Variety.com|publisher=Variety (magazine)|Variety|accessdate=7 September 2014</ref> He studied Hawking's accent and speech patterns under dialect coach Julia Wilson-Dickson to prepare for the role.<ref name=guardian>cite web |first=Andrew |last=Wilson-Dickson |title=Julia Wilson-Dickson obituary|url=https://www.TheGuardian.com/film/2015/oct/18/julia-wilson-dickson-obituary |website=TheGuardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|date=18 October 2015|accessdate=14 November 2015</ref> Marsh stated that what Redmayne had to do was not easy. "He had to take on enormous amounts of difficult preparation, as well as embracing the difficult physicality of the role. It's not just doing a disability. It's actually charting the course of an illness that erodes the body, and the mind has to project out from that erosion", he said. He added that Hawking gave him his blessing, and also revealed that, "[Hawking's] response was very positive, so much so that he offered to lend his voice, the real voice that he uses. The voice you hear in the latter part of the story is in fact Stephen's actual electronic voice as he uses it", he said.<ref name=Deadline.com-Oscar/> It was revealed to the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) audience that as the lights came up at a recent screening, a nurse had wiped a tear from Hawking's cheek.<ref name=VarietyCry/>

Composer Jóhann Jóhannsson scored ''The Theory of Everything''.  His score in the film has been described as including "[Jóhannsson's] signature blend of acoustic instruments and electronics".

During editing, filmmakers tried to remake Hawking's synthesised voice, but it did not turn out as they wanted. Hawking enjoyed the film enough that he granted them permission to use his own synthesised voice, which is heard in the final film.<ref>cite web|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin|title=How Eddie Redmayne became Stephen Hawking in 'The Theory of Everything'|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/eddie-redmayne-theory-of-everything-stephen-hawking-1201340498/ |website=Variety.com|publisher=Variety (magazine)|Variety|accessdate=24 February 2015</ref>

Historical accuracy
The film takes various dramatic liberties with the history it portrays. Writing for the film blog of UK daily newspaper ''The Guardian'', Michelle Dean noted: quote|''The Theory of Everything'''s marketing materials will tell you it is based on Jane Hawking's memoir of her marriage, a book published in the UK as ''Music to Move the Stars'', and then re-issued as ''Travelling to Infinity''. But the screenwriters rearranged the facts to suit certain dramatic conventions.  And while that always happens in these based-on-a-true-story films, the scale of the departure in ''The Theory of Everything'' is unusually wide. The film becomes almost dishonestendashin a way that feels unfair to both parties, and oddly, particularly Jane Hawking herself.<ref name=GuardianDisservice>cite web |url=https://www.TheGuardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/14/theory-of-everything-movie-jane-steven-hawking-memoir|title=The Theory of Everything does Jane Hawking a disservice |last=Dean |first=Michelle |date=14 November 2014 |website=TheGuardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=19 November 2016</ref>  In ''Slate (magazine)|Slate'', L.V. Anderson wrote that "the Stephen played by Eddie Redmayne is far gentler and more sensitive" than suggested in ''Travelling to Infinity''.<ref name=SlateAccurate>cite web |url=http://www.Slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/11/07/the_theory_of_everything_how_accurate_is_the_new_stephen_hawking_movie_starring.html |title=How accurate is The Theory of Everything? |last=Anderson|first=L.V.|date=7 November 2014|website=Slate.com|publisher=''Slate (magazine)|Slate''|accessdate=19 November 2016</ref> The ''Slate'' article further noted that the character Brian, Hawking's closest friend at Cambridge in the film, is not based on a real individual, but rather a composite of several of his real-life friends.<ref name=SlateAccurate/>

The film alters some of the details surrounding the beginning of Stephen and Jane's relationship, including how they met, as well as the fact that Jane knew about Stephen's disease before they started dating.<ref name=GuardianDisservice/> ''Slate'' also comments that the film underplays Hawking's stubbornness and refusal to accept outside assistance for his disorder.<ref name=SlateAccurate/>

For ''The Guardian'', Dean concluded by saying: quote|The movie presents the demise of their relationship as a beautiful, tear-soaked, mutually respectful conversation.  Of course that didn't actually happen either. Jane's book describes a protracted breakup that comes to a head in a screaming fight on vacation. She also described devastation when Hawking announced by letter he was leaving her for his second wife, Elaine Mason. He ended up married to Mason for 10 years before that fell apart, and then he and Jane mended fences. Which, as it happens, the movie fudges too. It tries to present the rapprochement as coming when Hawking was made a Companion of Honour in 1989, but that actually happened before the couple separated.<ref name=GuardianDisservice/>

Physicist Adrian Melott, a former student of Dennis W. Sciama|Dennis Sciama, Hawking's doctoral supervisor portrayed in the film, strongly criticised the portrayal of Sciama in the film.<ref>cite journal|title=Views: The Theory of Everything is missing something: letter from Adrian L Melott|last=Melott|first=Adrian L. |url=http://AstroGeo.OxfordJournals.org/content/56/2/2.9.3.full|year=2015|website=AstroGeo.OxfordJournals.org|publisher=Astronomy & Geophysics |volume=56 |issue=2 |page=2.9|doi=10.1093/astrogeo/atv057|accessdate=19 November 2016</ref>

In the film, when Stephen attends the opera in Geneva, his companion was actually Raymond LaFlamme, his PhD student.

Catherine Shoard of ''The Guardian'' wrote, "Redmayne towers: this is an astonishing, genuinely visceral performance which bears comparison with Daniel Day-Lewis in ''My Left Foot''".<ref>cite web|title=The Theory of Everything review: Hawking's story packs powerful punch |url=https://www.TheGuardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/theory-of-everything-review-hawking-eddie-redmayne |date=7 September 2014|website=TheGuardian.com|publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=7 September 2014</ref>  Lou Lumenick, in his review for ''The New York Post'', called the film "tremendously moving and inspirational".<ref>cite web|title=This Stephen Hawking biopic is a good bet for Oscar nods|url=https://nypost.com/2014/09/08/this-stephen-hawking-biopic-is-a-good-bet-for-oscar-nods/|date=8 September 2014|website=nypost.com|publisher=The New York Post|accessdate=8 September 2014</ref>  Justin Chang of ''Variety (magazine)|Variety'' remarked, "A stirring and bittersweet love story, inflected with tasteful good humor...."  He continued by praising the "superb performances" from Redmayne and Jones, as well commenting very positively about Jóhannsson's score, "whose arpeggio-like repetitions and progressions at times evoke the compositions of Philip Glass", whilst praising John Paul Kelly's production design, and Steven Noble's costumes.<ref>cite web |title=Toronto film review: 'The Theory of Everything'|url=https://variety.com/?p=1201300258|date=7 September 2014|website=Variety.com|publisher=Variety (magazine)|Variety|accessdate=7 September 2014</ref>  Leslie Felperin of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' remarked, "A solid, duly moving account of their complicated relationship, spanning roughly 25 years, and made with impeccable professional polish", praising Delhomme's cinematography as having "lush, intricately lit compositions", and adding "a splendor that keeps the film consistently watchable", and Jóhannsson's score as "dainty precision with a ineffable scientific quality about it".<ref>cite web|title='The Theory of Everything': Toronto review|url=http://www.HollywoodReporter.com/review/theory-everything-toronto-review-730837|date=7 September 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=7 September 2014</ref>  ''The Daily Telegraph'''s Tim Robey granted the film a positive review, stating that, "In its potted appraisal of Hawking's cosmology, ''The Theory of Everything'' bends over backwards to speak to the layman, and relies on plenty of second-hand inspiration.  But it borrows from the right sources, this theory.  And that's something", while praising Redmayne's performance, McCarten's script, and Delhomme's cinematography.<ref>cite web|title=The Theory of Everything, review: 'tasteful and affecting': Toronto review|url=http://www.Telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/toronto-film-festival/11081593/The-Theory-of-Everything-review-tasteful-and-affecting.html|date=8 September 2014|website=Telegraph.co.uk|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=8 September 2014</ref>  ''Deadline Hollywood'''s Pete Hammond marked McCarten's script and Marsh's direction for praise, and of the film's Toronto reception, wrote: "To say the response here was rapturous would not be understating the enthusiasm I heard — not just from pundits, but also Academy voters with whom I spoke.  One told me he came in with high expectations for a quality movie, and this one exceeded them".<ref name=DeadlineOscar/>

The film was not without its detractors.  Some criticised Marsh's focus on Hawking's romantic life.  Alonso Duralde of ''The Wrap'' stated that "Hawking's innovations and refusal to subscribe to outdated modes of thinking merely underscore the utter conventionality of his film biography".<ref>cite web |url=http://www.TheWrap.com/the-theory-of-everything-review-eddie-redmayne-stephen-hawking/|title='The Theory of Everything' review: Eddie Redmayne gives body and soul to a by-the-numbers biopic|website=TheWrap.com|publisher=The Wrap|first=Alonso|last=Duralde|date=8 September 2014|accessdate=11 November 2014</ref> Eric Kohn of ''Indiewire'' added that "James Marsh's biopic salutes the famous physicist's commitment, but falls short of exploring his brilliant ideas".<ref>cite web|url=http://www.Indiewire.com/article/toronto-review-eddie-redmayne-and-felicity-jones-salvage-stephen-hawking-biopic-the-theory-of-everything-20140908 |title=Toronto review: Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones salvage Stephen Hawking biopic 'The Theory of Everything' |website=Indiewire.com |publisher=Indiewire |first=Eric|last=Kohn|date=8 September 2014|accessdate=11 November 2014</ref>  Dennis Overbye of the ''New York Times'' noted: quote|The movie doesn't deserve any prizes for its drive-by muddling of Dr. Hawking's scientific work, leaving viewers in the dark about exactly why he is so famous. Instead of showing how he undermined traditional notions of space and time, it panders to religious sensibilities about what his work does or does not say about the existence of God, which in fact is very little.<ref name=NYT-20141028-DO>cite web|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|authorlink=Dennis Overbye|title=The leaky science of Hollywood – Stephen Hawking's movie life story is not very scientific|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/science/stephen-hawkings-movie-life-story-is-not-very-scientific.html|date=28 October 2014|website=nytimes.com|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=28 October 2014</ref>  Writing for ''The Guardian'''s film blog, Michelle Dean argues that the film does a disservice to Jane Wilde Hawking, by "rearrang[ing] the facts to suit certain dramatic conventions...
