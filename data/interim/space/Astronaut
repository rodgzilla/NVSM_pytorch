An astronaut or cosmonaut is a person trained by a List of human spaceflight programs|human spaceflight program to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft. Although generally reserved for professional space travelers, the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists, politicians, journalists, and tourists.<ref name="fact">cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/astro.pdf|title=Astronaut Fact Book|accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration|year=2006|author=NASA|format=PDF| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926023336/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/astro.pdf| archivedate= September 26, 2007 | deadurl=no</ref><ref name="utah">cite web|url=http://www.utahstatesman.com/campus_news/1.563784 |title=Former astronaut visits USU |accessdate=October 4, 2007 |publisher=The Utah Statesman |year=2005 |author=Marie MacKay |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926175913/http://www.utahstatesman.com/campus_news/1.563784 |archivedate=September 26, 2008 |df=mdy </ref>

Until 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies. With the suborbital flight of the privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the commercial astronaut.

In 1959, when both the United States and Soviet Union were planning, but had yet to launch humans into space, NASA Administrator T. Keith Glennan and his Deputy Administrator, Dr. Hugh Latimer Dryden|Hugh Dryden, discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called ''astronauts'' or ''cosmonauts''. Dryden preferred "cosmonaut", on the grounds that flights would occur in the ''cosmos'' (near space), while the "astro" prefix suggested flight to the stars. Most NASA Space Task Group members preferred "astronaut", which survived by common usage as the preferred American term.<ref>cite book | last=Dethloff | first=Henry C. | title=Suddenly Tomorrow Came...

In English-speaking nations, a professional space traveler is called an ''astronaut''.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.thespacerace.com/glossary/index.php?term=54|title=TheSpaceRace.com - Glossary of Space Exploration Terminology|publisher=|access-date=December 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105031754/http://www.thespacerace.com/glossary/index.php?term=54#|archive-date=January 5, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all</ref> The term derives from the Greek words ''ástron'' (ἄστρον), meaning "star", and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning "sailor". The first known use of the term "astronaut" in the modern sense was by Neil R. Jones in his 1930 short story "The Death's Head Meteor". The word itself had been known earlier; for example, in Percy Greg's 1880 book ''Across the Zodiac'', "astronaut" referred to a spacecraft. In ''Les Navigateurs de l'Infini'' (1925) by J.-H. Rosny aîné, the word ''astronautique'' (astronautic) was used. The word may have been inspired by "aeronaut", an older term for an air traveler first applied in 1784 to balloon (aircraft)|balloonists. An early use of "astronaut" in a non-fiction publication is Eric Frank Russell's poem "The Astronaut", appearing in the November 1934 ''Bulletin of the British Interplanetary Society''.<ref>Ingham, John L.: ''Into Your Tent'', Plantech (2010): page 82.</ref>

The first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual International Astronautical Congress in 1950, and the subsequent founding of the International Astronautical Federation the following year.<ref name="IAFpage">cite web|title=IAF History |publisher=International Astronautical Federation |author=IAF |date=August 16, 2010 |url=http://www.iafastro.org/index.html?title=History |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719102624/https://www.iafastro.org/index.html?title=History |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df=mdy </ref>

By convention, an astronaut employed by the Russian Federal Space Agency (or its Soviet space program|Soviet predecessor) is called a ''cosmonaut'' in English texts.<ref name="biopage"/> The word is an anglicisation of the Russian word ''kosmonavt'' (lang-ru|космонавт, IPA-ru|kəsmɐˈnaft), one who works in space outside the Earth's atmosphere, a space traveler,<ref name = "space traveller">cite book| last1 = Kotlyakov| first1 = Vladimir| last2 = Komarova| first2 = Anna| title = Elsevier's Dictionary of Geography: in English, Russian, French, Spanish and German|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6DhWw_cYLicC| year = 2006| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-08-048878-3 | page = 49</ref> which derives from the Greek words ''kosmos'' (κόσμος), meaning "universe", and ''nautes'' (ναύτης), meaning "sailor". Other countries of the former Eastern Bloc use variations of the Russian word ''kosmonavt'', such as the Poland|Polish ''kosmonauta''.

Coinage of the term ''kosmonavt'' has been credited to Soviet aeronautics pioneer Mikhail Tikhonravov (1900–1974).<ref>Cite book |last=Brzezinski |first=Matthew |authorlink=Matthew Brzezinski |year=2007 |title=Red Moon Rising: Sputnik and the Hidden Rivalries That Ignited the Space Age |url= |location=New York |publisher=Henry Holt & Co. |page=108 |isbn=978-0-8050-8147-3 </ref><ref>Cite book |author=Mike Gruntman |authorlink= |year=2004 |title=Blazing the Trail: The Early History of Spacecraft and Rocketry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XY9KXxF8OEC&pg=PA326 |location=Reston, VA |publisher=AIAA |page=326 |isbn=9781563477058 </ref> The first cosmonaut was Soviet Air Force pilot Yuri Gagarin, also the first person in space. Valentina Tereshkova, a Russian factory worker, was the first woman in space, as well as the first civilian among the Soviet cosmonaut or NASA astronaut corps to make a spaceflight. On March 14, 1995, Norman Thagard became the first American to ride to space on board a Russian launch vehicle, and thus became the first "American cosmonaut".

=Other terms=
With the rise of space tourism, NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency agreed to use the term "spaceflight participant" to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies.

While no nation other than the Russian Federation (and previously the former Soviet Union), the United States, and China have launched a manned spacecraft, several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries. Inspired partly by these missions, other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional English usage. For example, the term ''spationaut'' (French spelling: ''spationaute'') is sometimes used to describe French space travelers, from the Latin word ''spatium'' for "space", the Malay language|Malay term ''angkasawan'' was used to describe participants in the Angkasawan program, and the Indian Space Research Organisation hope to launch a ISRO Orbital Vehicle|spacecraft in 2022 that would carry ''Indian human spaceflight programme#Terminology|vyomanauts'', coined from the Sanskrit word for space.

Once selected, NASA astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas, including training for extravehicular activity in a facility such as NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory.<ref name="fact"/><ref name="training"/> Astronauts-in-training (astronaut candidates) may also experience short periods of weightlessness (Micro-g environment|microgravity) in an aircraft called the "Vomit Comet," the nickname given to a pair of modified KC-135s (retired in 2000 and 2004, respectively, and replaced in 2005 with a McDonnell Douglas C-9|C-9) which perform Parabola|parabolic flights.<ref name="comet"/> Astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high-performance jet aircraft. This is mostly done in T-38 Talon|T-38 jet aircraft out of Ellington Field, due to its proximity to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center.  Ellington Field is also where the Shuttle Training Aircraft is maintained and developed, although most flights of the aircraft are conducted from Edwards Air Force Base.

Astronauts is training must learn how to control and fly the Space Shuttle and, it is vital that they are familiar with the International Space Station so they know what they must do when they get there.<ref>Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/F_Astronauts_in_Training.html|title=NASA - Astronauts in Training|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Denise Miller: MSFC|access-date=2018-04-03</ref>

This study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in medical and high school students. It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations, where access to a trained physician is often rare.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html NASA - Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity<!-- Bot generated title -->] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029061057/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html |date=October 29, 2009 </ref><ref>A Pilot Study of Comprehensive Ultrasound Education at the Wayne State University School of Medicine: cite web|url=http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/5/745 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713124805/http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/5/745 |archivedate=July 13, 2010 </ref><ref>Evaluation of Shoulder Integrity in Space: First Report of Musculoskeletal US on the International Space Station: http://radiology.rsna.org/content/234/2/319.abstract</ref>

Over the last decade, flight surgeons and scientists at NASA have seen a pattern of vision problems in astronauts on long-duration space missions. The syndrome, known as visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP), has been reported in nearly two-thirds of space explorers after long periods spent aboard the International Space Station (ISS).

On November 2, 2017, scientists reported that significant changes in the position and structure of the brain have been found in astronauts who have taken Human spaceflight|trips in space, based on Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI studies. Astronauts who took longer space trips were associated with greater brain changes.<ref name="NEJM-20171102">cite journal |author=Roberts, Donna R. et al. |title=Effects of Spaceflight on Astronaut Brain Structure as Indicated on MRI |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1705129 |date=2 November 2017 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=377 |pages=1746–1753 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1705129 |accessdate=4 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107151313/http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1705129 |archive-date=November 7, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all </ref><ref name="QTZ-20171103">cite web |last=Foley |first=Katherine Ellen |title=Astronauts who take long trips to space return with brains that have floated to the top of their skulls |url=https://qz.com/1119668/space-travel-changes-astronauts-brains/ |date=3 November 2017 |work=Quartz (publication)|Quartz |accessdate=3 November 2017 </ref>

Food and drink

main|Space food

An astronaut on the International Space Station requires about 0.83 kilograms (1.83 pounds) weight of food inclusive of food packaging per meal each day. (The packaging for each meal weighs around 0.12 kilograms - 0.27 pounds)  Longer-duration missions require more food.

Shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appeal to their individual tastes. Five months before flight, menus are selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician. Foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment.  Caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure (BEE) formula.
On Earth, the average American uses about 35 gallons (132 liters) of water every day.  On board the ISS astronauts limit water use to only about three gallons (11 liters) per day.<ref>cite web|title=Human Needs: Sustaining Life During Exploration|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/everydaylife/jamestown-needs-fs.html|website=www.nasa.gov</ref>

Insignia
In Russia, cosmonauts are awarded Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation upon completion of their missions, often accompanied with the award of Hero of the Russian Federation.  This follows the practice established in the USSR where cosmonauts were usually awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.

At NASA, those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver Astronaut Badge#NASA Astronaut Pins|lapel pin. Once they have flown in space, they receive a gold pin. U.S. astronauts who also have active-duty military status receive a special qualification badge, known as the Astronaut Badge, after participation on a spaceflight. The United States Air Force also presents an Astronaut Badge to its pilots who exceed convert|50|mi|km in altitude.

Deaths
Main|List of spaceflight-related accidents and incidents#Astronaut fatalities

Eighteen astronauts (fourteen men and four women) have lost their lives during four space flights. By nationality, thirteen were American (including one born in India), four were Russian (Soviet Union), and one was Israeli.

Eleven people (all men) have lost their lives training for spaceflight: eight Americans and three Russians. Six of these were in crashes of training jet aircraft, one drowned during water recovery training, and four were due to fires in pure oxygen environments.

The Space Mirror Memorial, which stands on the grounds of the John F. Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died during spaceflight and during training in the space programs of the United States. In addition to twenty NASA career astronauts, the memorial includes the names of a U.S. Air Force X-15 test pilot, a U.S. Air Force officer who died while training for a then-classified military space program, and a civilian spaceflight participant.
