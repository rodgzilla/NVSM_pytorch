Religious cosmology (also  mythological cosmology) is a way of explaining the dynamic structure and order of the cosmos or universe as a process, from a religious perspective. This may include beliefs on origin in the form of a creation myth, subsequent evolution, current organizational form and nature, and eventual fate or destiny. There are various traditions in religion or Religion and mythology|religious mythology asserting how and why everything is the way it is and the significance of it all. Religious cosmologies describe the spatial lay-out of the universe in terms of the world in which people typically dwell as well as other dimensions, such as heaven or hell (places often believed to be above or below the earth); and, religious mythologies may include descriptions of an act or process of Creation myth|creation by a creator deity or a larger pantheon (gods)|pantheon of deities, explanations of the transformation of chaos into order, or the assertion that existence is a matter of endless cyclical transformations. Religious cosmology differs from a strictly scientific cosmology informed by the results of the study of astronomy and similar fields, and may differ in conceptualizations of the world's physical structure and place in the universe, its creation, and forecasts or predictions on its future. The scope of religious cosmology is more inclusive than a strictly Scientific method|scientific cosmology (physical cosmology) in that religious cosmology is not limited to experiential observation, testing of hypotheses, and proposals of theories; for example, religious cosmology may explain why everything is the way it is or seems to be the way it is and prescribing what humans should do in context. Variations in religious cosmology include those of Indian origin, such as Buddhist|Buddhism, Hindu, and Jain; the religious beliefs of China; and, the beliefs of the Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic faiths, such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Religious cosmologies have often developed into the formal logics of metaphysics|metaphysical systems, such as Platonism, Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, Daoism, Kabbalah, or the great chain of being.

Main|Buddhist cosmology

In Buddhism, like other Indian religions, there is no ultimate beginning nor final end to the universe. It considers all existence as eternal, and believes there is no creator god.<ref>cite book|last1=Blackburn|first1=Anne M.|last2=Samuels|first2=Jeffrey|title=Approaching the Dhamma: Buddhist Texts and Practices in South and Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktWAQAk7XPkC|year=2003|publisher=Pariyatti|isbn=978-1-928706-19-9|pages= 128–146</ref><ref>citation |last=Harvey |first=Peter |title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC&lpg=PP1&dq=buddhism%20introduction&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false |year=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |edition=2nd |isbn=9780521676748 |pages=36-38</ref> Buddhism views the universe as impermanent and always in flux.

<poem>
''Neither being (sat) nor non-being was as yet. What was concealed?
And where? And in whose protection?…Who really knows?
Who can declare it? Whence was it born, and whence came this creation? 
The devas (demigods) were born later than this world's creation, 
so who knows from where it came into existence? None can know from where 
creation has arisen, and whether he has or has not produced it.
He who surveys it in the highest heavens, 
He alone knows or perhaps He does not know."

Main|Jain cosmology

Jain cosmology considers the loka, or universe, as an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, having no beginning or an end.<ref>“This universe is not created nor sustained by anyone; It is self sustaining, without any base or support” “Nishpaadito Na Kenaapi Na Dhritah Kenachichch Sah Swayamsiddho Niradhaaro Gagane Kimtvavasthitah” [Yogaśāstra of Ācārya Hemacandra 4.106] Tr by Dr. A. S. Gopani</ref> :Category:Jain texts|Jain texts describe the shape of the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. This Universe, according to Jainism, is narrow at the top, broad at the middle and once again becomes broad at the bottom.<ref>See Hemacandras description of universe in Yogaśāstra “…Think of this loka as similar to man standing akimbo…”4.103-6</ref>

Mahapurana (Jainism)|IAST|Mahāpurāṇa of Ācārya Jinasena is famous for this quote:
"Some foolish men declare that a creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected. If God created the world, where was he before the creation? If you say he was transcendent then and needed no support, where is he now? How could God have made this world without any raw material? If you say that he made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression."

Ex nihilo

see also|Ex nihilo|Creationism

Around the time of Jesus or a little earlier, the Greek idea that God had actually created matter replaced the older idea that matter had always existed, but in a chaotic state. This concept, called ''creatio ex nihilo'', is now the accepted orthodoxy of most denominations of Judaism and Christianity. Most denominations of Christianity and Judaism believe that a single, uncreated God was responsible for the creation of the cosmos.<ref>One of the severest critics of religious cosmologies from the standpoint of physics was Adolf Grünbaum, 'The Poverty of Theistic Cosmology' (2004), now in his ''Collected Works'' (edited by Thomas Kupka), vol. I, New York: Oxford University Press 2013, ch. 7 (pp. 151-200); some earlier papers on the same subject can also be found in this volume</ref>

Main|Islamic cosmology|Sufi cosmology

File:Islamic cosmology.jpg|thumb|Cosmology according to Zakariya al-Qazwini. The Earth is considered flat and surrounded by a series of mountains—including Mount Qaf. Earth is supported by an ox that stands on Bahamut dwelling in a cosmic ocean; the ocean is inside a bowl that sits on top of an angel or jinn.<ref>Zakariya al-Qazwini. ''ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt wa gharā'ib al-mawjūdāt'' (The Wonders of Creation). Original published in 1553 AD</ref>

Islam teaches that God created the universe, including Earth's physical environment and human beings. The highest goal is to visualize the cosmos as a book of symbols for meditation and contemplation for spiritual upliftment or as a prison from which the human soul must escape to attain true freedom in the spiritual journey to God.<ref>http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e459?_hi=10&_pos=2</ref>

Below here there are some other citations from the Quran on cosmology.

"And the heavens We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander." 51:47 Sahih International

"Do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined 
together (as one unit of creation), before We clove them asunder? We made 
from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?"
21:30 Yusuf Ali translation

"The day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll rolled up for books 
(completed),- even as We produced the first creation, so shall We produce a 
new one: a promise We have undertaken: truly shall We fulfil it."
21:104 Yusuf Ali translation

=Mormon=

Main|Mormon cosmology

The Earth's creation, according to Mormon scripture, was not ''ex nihilo'', but organized from existing matter. The faith teaches that this earth is just one of many inhabited worlds, and that there are many governing heavenly bodies, including a planet or star Kolob which is said to be nearest the throne of God. According to the King Follett discourse, God the Father himself once passed through mortality like Jesus did, but how, when, or where that took place is unclear. The prevailing view among Mormons is that God once lived on a planet.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/mormon/beliefs/god_1.shtml "An explanation of Mormon beliefs about God"], BBC – Religions, 2009-10-02.</ref><ref>Jana Riess and Christopher Kimball Bigelow, ''Mormonism for Dummies'' (John Wiley & Sons, 2005, ISBN|978-0-7645-7195-4) ch. 3.</ref>

 Esoteric cosmology 

Esoteric cosmology is cosmology that is an intrinsic part of an Esoteric knowledge|esoteric or Occultism|occult system of thought. Esoteric cosmology maps out the universe with Plane (cosmology)|planes of existence and consciousness according to a specific worldview usually from a doctrine.

Gnosticism

Gnosticism|Gnostic teachings were contemporary with those of Neoplatonism. Gnosticism is an imprecise label, covering monistic as well as dualistic conceptions. Usually the higher worlds of Light, called the Pleroma or "fullness", are radically distinct from the lower world of Matter.  The emanation of the Pleroma and its godheads (called ''Aeons'') is described in detail in the various Gnostic tracts, as is the pre-creation crisis (a cosmic equivalent to the "fall" in Christianity|Christian thought) from which the material world comes about, and the way that the divine spark can attain salvation.<ref>cite book|last1=Guiley|first1=Rosemary Ellen|title=The Encyclopedia of Saints|date=2001|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York, NY|isbn=1438130260|page=396</ref>
