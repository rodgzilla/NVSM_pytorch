Energy development is the field of activities focused on obtaining sources of energy from natural resources. These activities include production of conventional, Alternative energy|alternative and Renewable energy|renewable sources of energy, and for the Waste heat|recovery and reuse of energy that would otherwise be wasted. Energy conservation and Efficient energy use|efficiency measures reduce the demand for energy development, and can have benefits to society with improvements to environmental issues.

Societies use energy for transportation, manufacturing, illumination, heating and air conditioning, and communication, for industrial, commercial, and domestic purposes.  Energy resources may be classified as primary resources, where the resource can be used in substantially its original form, or as secondary resources, where the energy source must be converted into a more conveniently usable form. Non-renewable resources are significantly depleted by human use, whereas renewable resources are produced by ongoing processes that can sustain indefinite human exploitation.

Thousands of people are employed in the energy industry. The conventional industry comprises the petroleum industry, the natural gas industry, the electrical power industry, and the nuclear industry. New energy industries include the renewable energy industry, comprising alternative and sustainable manufacture, distribution, and sale of alternative fuels.

Energy resources may be classified as primary resources, suitable for end use without conversion to another form, or secondary resources, where the usable form of energy required substantial conversion from a primary source.  Examples of primary energy resources are wind power, solar power, wood fuel, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, and uranium. Secondary resources are those such as electricity, hydrogen economy|hydrogen, or other synthetic fuels.

Another important classification is based on the time required to regenerate an energy resource.  "Renewable" resources are those that recover their capacity in a time significant by human needs. Examples are hydroelectric power or wind power, when the natural phenomena that are the primary source of energy are ongoing and not depleted by human demands.  Non-renewable resources are those that are significantly depleted by human usage and that will not recover their potential significantly during human lifetimes. An example of a non-renewable energy source is coal, which does not form naturally at a rate that would support human use.

 Fossil fuels

Main|Fossil fuel|Peak oil

Fossil fuel (''primary non-renewable fossil'') sources burn coal or hydrocarbon fuels, which are the remains of the decomposition of plants and animals. There are three main types of fossil fuels: coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Another fossil fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), is principally derived from the production of natural gas. Heat from burning fossil fuel is used either directly for space heating and process heating, or converted to mechanical energy for vehicles, industrial processes, or electrical power generation. These fossil fuels are part of the carbon cycle and thus allow stored solar energy to be used today.

The use of fossil fuels in the 18th and 19th Century set the stage for the Industrial Revolution.

Fossil fuels make up the bulk of the world's current primary energy sources. In 2005, 81% of the world's energy needs was met from fossil sources.<ref>International Energy Agency: Key World Energy Statistics 2007. S. 6</ref> The technology and infrastructure already exist for the use of fossil fuels. Liquid fuels derived from petroleum deliver a great deal of usable energy per unit of weight or volume, which is advantageous when compared with lower energy density sources such as a battery (electricity)|battery. Fossil fuels are currently economical for decentralised energy use.

Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources, which will eventually decline in production <ref>Peaking of World Oil Production: Impacts, Mitigation, and Risk Management. Was at: www.pppl.gov/polImage.cfm?doc_Id=44&size_code=Doc</ref> and become exhausted.  While the processes that created fossil fuels are ongoing, fuels are consumed far more quickly than the natural rate of replenishment.  Extracting fuels becomes increasingly costly as society consumes the most accessible fuel deposits.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.rigzone.com/analysis/rigs/insight.asp?i_id=213 |title=Big Rig Building Boom |date=2006-04-13 |work= |publisher=Rigzone.com |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021000239/http://rigzone.com/analysis/rigs/insight.asp?i_id=213 |archivedate=2007-10-21 |quote= |accessdate=2008-01-18 |deadurl=yes |df= </ref> Extraction of fossil fuels results in environmental degradation, such as the strip mining and mountaintop removal of coal.

The fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy is the energy efficiency of a particular vehicle, is given as a ratio of distance travelled per unit of Motor fuel|fuel consumed. Weight-specific efficiency (efficiency per unit weight) may be stated for freight, and passenger-specific efficiency (vehicle efficiency per passenger).

The combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of pollution into the atmosphere. The fossil fuels are mainly carbon compounds.  During combustion, carbon dioxide is released, and also nitrogen oxides, soot and other fine particulates. Man-made carbon dioxide according to the IPCC contributes to global warming.<ref>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007): IPCC Fourth Assessment Report - Working Group I Report on "The Physical Science Basis".</ref>
Other emissions from fossil fuel power station include sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds (VOC), Mercury (element)|mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, and other heavy metals including traces of uranium.<ref>cite web | url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html | title=Environmental impacts of coal power: air pollution | date=18 August 2005 | publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists | accessdate=18 January 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115204952/http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html | archivedate=15 January 2008 | df= </ref><ref>NRDC: [http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/files/coalmining.pdf There Is No Such Thing as "Clean Coal"] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730142650/http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/files/coalmining.pdf |date=July 30, 2012 </ref>

Nuclear power is the use of nuclear fission  to generate useful heat and electricity. Fission of uranium produces nearly all economically significant nuclear power. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators form a very small component of energy generation, mostly in specialized applications such as deep space vehicles.

Nuclear power plants, excluding Nuclear marine propulsion|naval reactors, provided about 5.7% of the world's energy and 13% of the world's electricity in 2012.<ref>

Recent experiments in extraction of uranium use polymer ropes that are coated with a substance that selectively absorbs uranium from seawater. This process could make the considerable volume of uranium dissolved in seawater exploitable for energy production.  Since ongoing geologic processes carry uranium to the sea in amounts comparable to the amount that would be extracted by this process, in a sense the sea-borne uranium becomes a sustainable resource.<ref>cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2016/07/01/uranium-seawater-extraction-makes-nuclear-power-completely-renewable/#34e87e246e2a|title=Uranium Seawater Extraction Makes Nuclear Power Completely Renewable|first=James|last=Conca|date=|website=forbes.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424213313/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2016/07/01/uranium-seawater-extraction-makes-nuclear-power-completely-renewable/#34e87e246e2a|archivedate=24 April 2018|df=</ref><ref>[http://pubs.acs.org/toc/iecred/55/15#UraniuminSeawater April 20, 2016 Volume 55, Issue 15 Pages 4101-4362 In this issue:Uranium in Seawater] Page 962 to 965</ref>

The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source. Nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low direct fuel costs.

In recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult, which affects large projects such as nuclear reactors, with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks.<ref name=kidd2011/> In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance, notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavoda in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out.<ref name=kidd2011>cite web|url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&storyCode=2058653 |title=New reactors—more or less? |author=Kidd, Steve |date=January 21, 2011 |work=Nuclear Engineering International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212195417/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&storyCode=2058653 |archivedate=2011-12-12 |df= </ref> Where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure, this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects.<ref name=kidd2011/>

File:ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg|thumb| The 22,500 Megawatt|MW Three Gorges Dam in China – the List of conventional hydroelectric power stations#Hydroelectric power stations|world's largest hydroelectric power station

Hydroelectricity  is electric power generated by hydropower; the force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity <ref>cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf|format=pdf|access-date=2017-05-24|title=Renewables 2016: Global Status Report|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525173336/http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf|archivedate=2017-05-25|df=</ref>page needed|date=May 2017 and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the Three Gorges Dam in China, Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri Dam in Venezuela.<ref name=wi2012>cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |work= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924062448/http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |archivedate=2014-09-24 |df= </ref>

The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.<ref name=wi2012/> Hydro is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. However, damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife.<ref name=wi2012/> Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and has a considerably lower output level of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than fossil fuel powered energy plants.<ref name="REN21-2011">[http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/REN21_GSR2011.pdf Renewables 2011 Global Status Report, page 25, Hydropower] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409013321/http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/REN21_GSR2011.pdf |date=April 9, 2012 , ''REN21'', published 2011, accessed 2011-11-7.</ref>

Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and solar thermal energy|solar thermal collectors to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air.

In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that "the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly energy independence|import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global.

Photovoltaics (PV) is a method of Electricity generation|generating electrical power by converting solar radiation into direct current electricity using semiconductors that exhibit the photovoltaic effect. Photovoltaic power generation employs solar panels composed of a number of solar cells containing a photovoltaic material. Materials presently used for photovoltaics include monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, and copper indium gallium selenide/sulfide. Due to the increased demand for renewable energy sources, the manufacturing of solar cells and Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic arrays has advanced considerably in recent years.

A biofuel is a fuel that contains energy from geologically recent carbon fixation. These fuels are produced from living organisms. Examples of this carbon fixation occur in plants and microalgae. These fuels are made by a biomass conversion (biomass refers to recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form. This new biomass can be used for biofuels. Biofuels have increased in popularity because of rising oil prices and the need for energy security.

Bioethanol is an alcohol made by Ethanol fermentation|fermentation, mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as Maize|corn or sugarcane. cellulose|Cellulosic biomass, derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a gasoline Fuel additive|additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the Biofuel in the United States|USA and in Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil. Current plant design does not provide for converting the lignin portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

Biodiesel is made from vegetable oils and animal fats. Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a diesel fuel|diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly,<ref>Glassley, William E. (2010). ''Geothermal Energy: Renewable Energy and the Environment'', CRC Press, ISBN|9781420075700.</ref> but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels.

The Earth's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs, but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited. Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive. Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology, energy prices, subsidies, and interest rates.

= Oceanic =
Main|Marine energy

Marine energy or marine power (also sometimes referred to as ocean energy, ocean power, or marine and hydrokinetic energy) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and Ocean thermal energy|ocean temperature differences. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy, or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to Electricity generation|generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries.

The term marine energy encompasses both wave power i.e. power from surface waves, and tidal power i.e. obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water.
The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.

Efficient energy use reduces the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, building insulation|insulating a home allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing fluorescent lamps or natural Skylight (window)|skylights reduces the amount of energy required for illumination compared to incandescent light bulbs. Compact fluorescent lights use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights.  Improvements in energy efficiency are most often achieved by adopting an efficient technology or production process.<ref>Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark (2007).

Reducing energy use may save consumers money,  if the energy savings offsets the cost of an energy efficient technology.  Reducing energy use reduces emissions.

Coal, petroleum and their derivatives are delivered by boat, Rail transport|rail, or road. Petroleum and natural gas may also be delivered by pipeline transport|pipeline, and coal via a Slurry pipeline. Fuels such as gasoline and Liquified petroleum gas|LPG may also be delivered via aircraft. Natural gas pipelines must maintain a certain minimum pressure to function correctly. The higher costs of ethanol transportation and storage are often prohibitive.<ref>

main|Electrical grid

Electricity grids are the electrical network|networks used to Electric power transmission|transmit and Electricity distribution|distribute electric power|power from production source to end user, when the two may be hundreds of kilometres away.  Sources include electrical generation plants such as a nuclear reactor, coal burning power plant, etc.  A combination of sub-stations and transmission lines are used to maintain a constant flow of electricity. Grids may suffer from transient Power blackout|blackouts and power outage|brownouts, often due to weather damage. During certain extreme space weather events solar wind can interfere with transmissions. Grids also have a predefined carrying capacity or load that cannot safely be exceeded. When power requirements exceed what's available, failures are inevitable. To prevent problems, power is then rationed.

Industrialised countries such as Canada, the United States|US, and Australia are among the highest per capita consumers of electricity in the world, which is possible thanks to a widespread electrical distribution network. The US grid is one of the most advanced, although infrastructure maintenance is becoming a problem. [https://web.archive.org/web/20041014214845/http://currentenergy.lbl.gov/ CurrentEnergy] provides a realtime overview of the electricity supply and demand for California, Texas, and the Northeast of the US. African countries with small scale electrical grids have a correspondingly low annual per capita usage of electricity. One of the most powerful power grids in the world supplies power to the state of Queensland, Australia.

= Wireless energy transfer =

Wireless power transfer is a process whereby electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to an electrical load that does not have a built-in power source, without the use of interconnecting wires. Currently available technology is limited to short distances and relatively low power level.

Orbiting solar power collectors would require wireless transmission of power to Earth. The proposed method involves creating a large beam of microwave-frequency radio waves, which would be aimed at a collector antenna site on the Earth. Formidable technical challenges exist to ensure the safety and profitability of such a scheme.

 Storage

Main|Energy storage|List of energy storage projects

Energy storage is accomplished by devices or physical media that store energy to perform useful operation at a later time. A device that stores energy is sometimes called an Accumulator (energy)|accumulator.

All forms of energy are either potential energy (e.g. Chemical energy|Chemical, gravitational, Electric potential energy|electrical energy, temperature differential, latent heat, etc.) or kinetic energy (e.g. momentum). Some technologies provide only short-term energy storage, and others can be very long-term such as power to gas using hydrogen or methane and the Seasonal thermal energy storage|storage of heat or cold between opposing seasons in deep aquifers or bedrock.  A wind-up clock stores potential energy (in this case mechanical, in the spring tension), a Battery (electricity)|battery stores readily convertible chemical energy to operate a mobile phone, and a Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dam stores Electrical power industry|energy in a reservoir as gravitational potential energy. Thermal energy storage#Air conditioning|Ice storage tanks store ice (thermal energy in the form of latent heat) at night to meet peak demand for cooling. Fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died, became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels. Even food (which is made by the same process as fossil fuels) is a form of energy stored in chemical form.

 History 

File:Doel Kerncentrale.JPG|thumb|right|Energy generators past and present at Doel, Belgium: 17th-century windmill ''Scheldemolen'' and 20th-century Doel Nuclear Power Station

Since prehistory, when humanity discovered fire to warm up and roast food, through the Middle Ages in which populations built windmills to grind the wheat, until the modern era in which nations can get electricity splitting the atom. Man has sought endlessly for energy sources.

Except nuclear, geothermal and tidal power|tidal, all other energy sources are from current solar isolation or from fossil remains of plant and animal life that relied upon sunlight. Ultimately, solar power|solar energy itself is the result of the Sun's nuclear fusion. Geothermal power from hot, hardened Rock (geology)|rock above the magma of the Earth's core is the result of the decay of radioactive materials present beneath the Earth's crust, and nuclear fission relies on man-made fission of heavy radioactive elements in the Earth's crust; in both cases these elements were produced in supernova explosions before the formation of the solar system.

Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the question of the future of energy supplies has been of interest. In 1865, William Stanley Jevons published ''The Coal Question'' in which he saw that the reserves of coal were being depleted and that oil was an ineffective replacement. In 1914, United States Bureau of Mines|U.S. Bureau of Mines stated that the total production was convert|5.7|Goilbbl|m3. In 1956, Geophysicist M. King Hubbert deduces that U.S. oil production would Hubbert peak theory|peak between 1965 and 1970 and that oil production will peak "within half a century" on the basis of 1956 data. In 1989, predicted peak by Colin Campbell (geologist)|Colin Campbell<ref>"Oil Price Leap in the Early Nineties," Noroil, December 1989, pages 35–38.</ref> In 2004, OPEC estimated, with substantial investments, it would nearly double oil output by 2025<ref>Opec Oil Outlook to 2025 Table 4, Page 12</ref>

The environmental movement has emphasized sustainability of energy use and development.<ref>Sustainable Development and Innovation in the Energy Sector.

Nutzinger, Thomas Ziesemer. Springer, December 5, 2005.</ref> Renewable energy is sustainable in its production; the available supply will not be diminished for the foreseeable future - millions or billions of years.  "Sustainability" also refers to the ability of the environment to cope with waste products, especially air pollution.  Sources which have no direct waste products (such as wind, solar, and hydropower) are brought up on this point. With global demand for energy growing, the need to adopt various energy sources is growing. Energy conservation is an alternative or complementary process to energy development.  It reduces the demand for energy by using it efficiently.

The notion of resilience in energy was detailed in the 1982 book ''Brittle Power: Energy Strategy for National Security''.<ref>[http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/brittlepower.htm Brittle Power: Energy Plan for National Security] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702233352/http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/brittlepower.htm |date=2009-07-02 . Amory B. Lovins and L. Hunter Lovins (1982).</ref> The authors argued that simply switching to domestic energy would not be secure inherently because the true weakness is the interdependent and vulnerable energy infrastructure of the United States. Key aspects such as gas lines and the electrical power grid are centralized and easily susceptible to disruption. They conclude that a "resilient energy supply" is necessary for both national security and the environment. They recommend a focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy that is decentralized.<ref>[http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/FragileDomEnergy_AtlanticMonthly_Nov1983.pdf "The Fragility of Domestic Energy."] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106001526/http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/FragileDomEnergy_AtlanticMonthly_Nov1983.pdf |date=2009-01-06  Amory B.

In 2008, former Intel Corporation Chairman and CEO Andrew Grove looked to energy resilience, arguing that complete independence is unfeasible given the global market for energy.<ref>[http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future "Our Electric Future."] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825064622/http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future/ |date=2014-08-25  Andrew Grove.

A diverse energy supply will be less affected by the disruption in supply of any one source. He reasons that another feature of electrification is that electricity is "sticky" – meaning the electricity produced in the U.S. is to stay there because it cannot be transported overseas.  According to Grove, a key aspect of advancing electrification and energy resilience will be converting the U.S. automotive fleet from gasoline-powered to electric-powered. This, in turn, will require the modernization and expansion of the electrical power grid. As organizations such as The Reform Institute have pointed out, advancements associated with the developing smart grid would facilitate the ability of the grid to absorb vehicles ''en masse'' connecting to it to charge their batteries.<ref>[https://www.policyarchive.org/bitstream/handle/10207/16484/Electric_Car_Reform_Brief_FINAL_PDF_3-4-09.pdf?sequence=1 Resilience in Energy: Building Infrastructure Today for Tomorrow's Automotive Fuel.

Energy production usually requires an energy investment. Drilling for oil or building a wind power plant requires energy. The fossil fuel resources that are left are often increasingly difficult to extract and convert. They may thus require increasingly higher energy investments. If investment is greater than the value of the energy produced by the resource, it is no longer an effective energy source.  These resources are no longer an energy source but may be exploited for value as raw materials.  New technology may lower the energy investment required to extract and convert the resources, although ultimately basic physics sets limits that cannot be exceeded.

Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation.<ref>cite web|url=http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html|title=Eating Fossil Fuels|work=Resilience|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611071544/http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html|archivedate=2007-06-11|df=</ref> The peaking of world hydrocarbon production (peak oil) may lead to significant changes, and require sustainable methods of production.<ref>[http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil Peak Oil: the threat to our food security] webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714220834/http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil |date=July 14, 2009  retrieved 28 May 2009</ref> One vision of a sustainable energy future involves all human structures on the earth's surface (i.e., buildings, vehicles and roads) doing artificial photosynthesis (using sunlight to split water as a source of hydrogen and absorbing carbon dioxide to make fertilizer) efficiently than plants.<ref>Faunce TA, Lubitz W, Rutherford AW, MacFarlane D, Moore, GF, Yang P, Nocera DG, Moore TA, Gregory DH, Fukuzumi S, Yoon KB, Armstrong FA, Wasielewski MR, Styring S. ‘Energy and Environment Case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis.’ Energy and Environmental Science 2013, 6 (3), 695 - 698 DOI:10.1039/C3EE00063J cite web |url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/ee/c3ee00063j |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816015954/http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/ee/c3ee00063j |archivedate=2013-08-16 |df=  (accessed 13 March 2013)</ref>
