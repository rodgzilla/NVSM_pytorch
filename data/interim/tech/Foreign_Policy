 History 
''Foreign Policy'' was founded in the winter of 1970-71 by Samuel P. Huntington, professor of Harvard University, and his friend Warren Demian Manshel to give a voice to alternative views about American foreign policy at the time of the Vietnam War.<ref>cite web |title=Samuel Huntington, 1927-2008 |url= https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/02/16/samuel_huntington_1927_2008 |accessdate=13 September 2014 |newspaper= Foreign Policy |date=16 February 2009</ref><ref>cite web |title=100 Years of Impact: A Timeline of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |url= http://carnegieendowment.org/about/timeline100/index.html |accessdate=22 April 2015 |newspaper=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</ref> Huntington hoped it would be "serious but not scholarly, lively but not glib."<ref name="Samuel Huntington, 1927-2008">cite news |last=Yester |first=Katherine |title=Samuel Huntington, 1927-2008 |url= https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/02/16/samuel_huntington_1927_2008 |accessdate=13 September 2014 |newspaper= Foreign Policy |date=16 February 2009</ref> 
In the spring of 1978, after six years of close partnership, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace acquired full ownership of ''Foreign Policy''. In 2000, a format change was implemented from a slim quarterly academic journal to a bimonthly magazine. Also, it launched international editions in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.

In September 2008, ''Foreign Policy'' was bought by The Washington Post Company (now Graham Holdings Company).<ref name="FP purchased by WaPo">cite news |last=Ahrens |first=Frank |title= Post Co.
