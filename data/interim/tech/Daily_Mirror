The ''Daily Mirror'' is a British national daily Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspaper founded in 1903. It is owned by parent company Reach plc. From 1985 to 1987, and from 1997 to 2002, the title on its masthead (publishing)|masthead was simply ''The Mirror''. It had an average daily print circulation of 716,923 in December 2016, dropping markedly to 587,803 the following year.<ref name='circ'>cite web|title=Print ABCs: Seven UK national newspapers losing print sales at more than 10 per cent year on year|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/print-abcs-seven-uk-national-newspapers-losing-print-sales-at-more-than-10-per-cent-year-on-year/|website=Press Gazette|accessdate=28 January 2017</ref> Its Sunday sister paper is the ''Sunday Mirror''.  Unlike other major British tabloids such as ''The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun'' and the ''Daily Mail'', the ''Mirror'' has no separate Scottish edition; this function is performed by the ''Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record'' and ''Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail'', which incorporate certain stories from the ''Mirror'' that are of Scottish significance.

Originally pitched to the middle-class reader, it was converted into a working-class newspaper after 1934, in order to reach a larger audience. The ''Mirror'' has had a number of owners. It was founded by Alfred Harmsworth, who sold it to his brother Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Harold Harmsworth (from 1914 Lord Rothermere) in 1913. In 1963 a restructuring of the media interests of the Harmsworth family led to the ''Mirror'' becoming a part of IPC Media#International Publishing Corporation|International Publishing Corporation. During the mid 1960s, daily sales exceeded 5 million copies, a feat never repeated by it or any other daily (non-Sunday) British newspaper since.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928073311/http://www.mmc.gov.uk/rep_pub/reports/1985/fulltext/190c02.pdf United Newspapers PLC and Fleet Holdings PLC]'', Monopolies and Mergers Commission (1985), pp.5&ndash;16</ref> The ''Mirror'' was owned by Robert Maxwell between 1984 and 1991. The paper went through a protracted period of crisis after his death before merging with the regional newspaper group Trinity in 1999 to form Trinity Mirror.

During the 1930s the paper was editorially sympathetic to Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/revealed-the-fascist-past-of-the-daily-mirror-77871.html "Revealed: the fascist past of the Daily Mirror"]</ref> The paper has consistently supported the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party since the United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/may/04/general-election-newspaper-support "Newspaper support in UK general elections"], ''The Guardian'', 4 May 2010.

History

File:Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe - Project Gutenberg eText 15305.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe), founder of the ''Daily Mirror''
''The Daily Mirror'' was launched on 2 November 1903 by Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe) as a newspaper for women, run by women.<ref>Cite web |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Mirror-British-newspaper |title=The Mirror ! British newspaper |work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=26 December 2017</ref> Hence the name: he said, "I intend it to be really a mirror of feminine life as well on its grave as on its lighter sides&nbsp;... to be entertaining without being frivolous, and serious without being dull".<ref>''Daily Mirror'' No. 1 (2 November 1903) page 3</ref> It cost one Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|penny (equivalent to Inflation|UK|10 / 24|1903|r=0|fmt=cp in Inflation-year|UK).

It was not an immediate success and in 1904 Harmsworth decided to turn it into a pictorial newspaper with a broader focus. Harmsworth appointed Hamilton Fyfe as editor and all of the paper's female journalists were fired. The masthead was changed to ''The Daily Illustrated Mirror'', which ran from 26 January to 27 April 1904 (issues 72 to 150), when it reverted to ''The Daily Mirror''.<ref name=Albion>Albion (history journal)|Albion (1973) Vol 5, 2-page 150</ref> The first issue of the relaunched paper did not have advertisements on the front page as previously, but instead news text and engraved pictures (of a traitor and an actress), with the promise of photographs inside.<ref>''Daily Mirror'' issue 72, 26 January 1904</ref> Two days later, the price was dropped to one Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny and to the masthead was added: "A paper for men and women".<ref>''Daily Illustrated Mirror'' issue 74, 28 January 1904</ref> This combination was more successful: by issue 92, the guaranteed circulation was 120,000 copies<ref>''Daily Illustrated Mirror'' issue 92, 18 February 1904</ref> and by issue 269, it had grown to 200,000:<ref>''Daily Mirror'' issue 269, 13 September 1904</ref> by then the name had reverted and the front page was mainly photographs. Circulation grew to 466,000 making it the second-largest morning newspaper.<ref>''Daily Mirror'' issue 1335, 8 February 1908</ref>

Alfred Harmsworth sold the newspaper to his brother Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Harold Harmsworth (from 1914 Lord Rothermere) in 1913. In 1917, the price was increased to one penny.<ref name=DM4163>''Daily Mirror'' issue 4163, 26 February 1917</ref> Circulation continued to grow: in 1919, some issues sold more than a million copies a day, making it the largest daily picture paper.<ref name=DM4856>''Daily Mirror'' issue 4856, 19 May 1919</ref> In 1924 the newspaper sponsored the  1924 Women's Olympiad held at Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge in London.

Lord Rothermere was a friend of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and directed the ''Mirror'''s editorial stance towards them in the early 1930s.<ref name="Griffiths1980">Cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Richard|title=Fellow Travellers of the Right: British Enthusiasts for Nazi Germany, 1933-9|year=1980|publisher=Constable|location=London|isbn=0-09-463460-2|postscript="."</ref><ref>Roy Greenslade, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/dec/06/dailymail-oswald-mosley Don't damn the Daily Mail for its fascist flirtation 80 years ago], theguardian.com (7 December 2011)</ref> On Monday, 22 January, 1934 the Daily Mirror ran the headline "Give the Blackshirts a helping hand" urging readers to join Sir Mosley's British Union of Fascists, and giving the address to which to send membership applications. <ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/revealed-the-fascist-past-of-the-daily-mirror-77871.html</ref>By the mid-1930s, the ''Mirror'' was struggling – it and the ''Mail'' were the main casualties of the early 1930s circulation war that saw the ''Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald'' and the ''Daily Express'' establish circulations of more than two million, and Rothermere decided to sell his shares in it.

In 1935 Rothermere sold the paper to H. G. Bartholomew and Hugh Cudlipp.<ref> McKibbin, Ross. ''Classes and Cultures: England 1918-1951''.

During the Second World War the ''Mirror'' positioned itself as the paper of the ordinary soldier and civilian, and was critical of the political leadership and the established parties. At one stage, the paper was threatened with closure following the publication of a Philip Zec political cartoon|cartoon (captioned by William Connor), which was misinterpreted by Winston Churchill and Herbert Morrison.<ref name=cassandra>cite book |title=Cassandra: Reflections in a Mirror |first=Robert |last=Connor |publisher=Cassell |year =1969 |location =London |isbn= 978-0-304-93341-9</ref> In the United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election the paper strongly supported the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party in its eventual landslide victory. In doing so, the paper supported Herbert Morrison, who co-ordinated Labour's campaign, and recruited his former antagonist Philip Zec to reproduce, on the front page, a popular VE Day cartoon on the morning of the election, suggesting that Labour were the only party who could maintain peace in post-war Britain.<ref name="tabloidnation"/> By the late 1940s, it was selling 4.5&nbsp;million copies a day, outstripping the ''Express''; for some 30 years afterwards, it dominated the British daily newspaper market, selling more than 5 million copies a day at its peak in the mid-1960s.

The ''Mirror'' was an influential model for German tabloid ''Bild'', which was founded in 1952 and became Europe's biggest-selling newspaper.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,412021,00.html Sex, Smut and Shock: Bild Zeitung Rules Germany] Spiegel Online 25 April 2006</ref>

In 1955, the ''Mirror'' and its stablemate the ''Sunday Pictorial'' (later to become the ''Sunday Mirror'') began printing a northern edition in Manchester. In 1957 it introduced the Andy Capp cartoon, created by Reg Smythe from Hartlepool, in the northern editions.Citation needed|date=December 2017

The ''Mirror'''s mass working class readership had made it the United Kingdom's best-selling daily tabloid newspaper. In 1960, it acquired the ''Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald'' (the popular daily of the labour movement) when it bought Odhams, in one of a series of takeovers which created the IPC Media|International Publishing Corporation (IPC). The ''Mirror'' management did not want the ''Herald'' competing with the ''Mirror'' for readers, and in 1964, relaunched it as a mid-market paper, now named ''The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun''. When it failed to win readers, the ''Sun'' was sold to Rupert Murdoch – who immediately relaunched it as a more populism|populist and sensationalist tabloid and a direct competitor to the ''Mirror''.

<!-- I didn't put this in the "Famous Features", as Mirrorscope was short-lived, and not famous! -->
In an attempt to cater to a different kind of reader, the ''Mirror'' launched the "Mirrorscope" pull-out section on 30 January 1968. The ''Press Gazette'' commented: "The ''Daily Mirror'' launched its revolutionary four-page supplement "Mirrorscope". The ambitious brief for the supplement, which ran on Wednesdays and Fridays, was to deal with international affairs, politics, industry, science, the arts and business".<ref>cite news |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=27950 |work=Press Gazette |title=Back Issues 23.01.03 |date=23 March 2009 |accessdate=19 July 2009</ref> The ''British Journalism Review'' said in 2002 that "Mirrorscope" was "a game attempt to provide serious analysis in the rough and tumble of the tabloids".<ref>cite journal |url=http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2002/no4_evans.htm|title=Attacking the devil|work=British Journalism Review |volume=13 |issue=4 |year=2002 |pages=6–14</ref> It failed to attract significant numbers of new readers, and the pull-out section was abandoned, its final issue appearing on 27 August 1974.Citation needed|date=December 2017

In 1978, ''The Sun'' overtook the ''Mirror'' in circulation, and in 1984 the ''Mirror'' was sold to Robert Maxwell. After Maxwell's death in 1991, David Montgomery (newspaper executive)|David Montgomery became Mirror Group's CEO, and a period of cost-cutting and production changes ensued. The ''Mirror'' went through a protracted period of crisis before merging with the regional newspaper group Trinity to form Trinity Mirror in 1999. Printing of the ''Daily'' and ''Sunday Mirror'' moved to Trinity Mirror's facilities in Watford and Oldham.Citation needed|date=December 2017

Under the editorship of Piers Morgan (from October 1995 to May 2004) the paper saw a number of controversies.<ref>Cite web |url= https://www.britannica.com/biography/Piers-Morgan#ref1092939 |title=Piers Morgan ! British journalist and television personality|work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=26 December 2017</ref> Morgan was widely criticised and forced to apologise for the headline "ACHTUNG!

In 2000, Morgan was the subject of an investigation after Suzy Jagger wrote a story in ''The Daily Telegraph'' revealing that he had bought pound sterling|£20,000 worth of shares in the computer company Viglen soon before the ''Mirror'' 's 'City Slickers' column tipped Viglen as a good buy.<ref name="lie">Cite news |title=Mirror editor saw his shares soar after paper tipped company |author=Jagger, Suzy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/02/02/nmir02.html |date=2 February 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021122223139/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F2000%2F02%2F02%2Fnmir02.html |archivedate=22 November 2002 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |deadurl=yes  </ref> Morgan was found by the Press Complaints Commission to have breached the Code of Conduct on financial journalism, but kept his job.

In 2002, the ''Mirror'' attempted to move mid-market, claiming to eschew the more trivial stories of show-business and gossip. The paper changed its masthead logo from red to black (and occasionally blue), in an attempt to dissociate itself from the term "red tops|red top", a term for a sensationalist mass-market tabloid. (On 6 April 2005, the red top came back.) Under then-editor Piers Morgan, the newspaper's editorial stance opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and ran many front pages critical of the war. It also gave financial support to the 15 February 2003 anti-war protest, paying for a large screen and providing thousands of placards. Morgan re-hired John Pilger, who had been sacked during Robert Maxwell's ownership of the Mirror titles. Despite such changes, Morgan was unable to halt the paper's decline in circulation, a decline shared by its direct Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid rivals ''The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun'' and the ''Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star''.Citation needed|date=April 2009

Morgan was fired from the ''Mirror'' on 14 May 2004 after authorising the newspaper's publication of photographs allegedly showing Iraqi prisoners being abused by British Army soldiers from the Queen's Lancashire Regiment.<ref>Cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/05/13/iraq.abuse.statement/index.html |title=Daily Mirror statement in full |publisher=CNN |date=13 May 2004 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20041125053916/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/05/13/iraq.abuse.statement/index.html |archivedate=25 November 2004 |accessdate=22 May 2010</ref> Within days the photographs were shown to be fakes.

Political allegiance
The ''Daily Mirror'' has traditionally backed the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party at general elections.

On 3 May 1979, the day of the United Kingdom general election, 1979|general election, the ''Daily Mirror'' urged its readers to vote for the governing Labour Party led by James Callaghan.<ref name="century"/> As widely predicted by the opinion polls, Labour lost this election, which was won by the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party and saw Margaret Thatcher become Prime Minister.<ref name="century">cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/2010/04/20/general-election-2010-a-century-of-daily-mirror-front-pages-115875-22198683/ |title=A century of Daily Mirror front pages |work=Daily Mirror |location=London |date=20 April 2010</ref> The ''Mirror'''s continued support of the Labour government was in spite of its falling popularity over the previous few months which had been the result of the Winter of Discontent, where the country was crippled by numerous public sector strikes.<ref>cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml |publisher=BBC News |title=Politics 97 |date=3 May 1979</ref>

By the time of the United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election, Labour support was at a postwar low, partly due to the strong challenge by the recently formed SDP-Liberal Alliance. Despite this, the ''Daily Mirror'' remained loyal to Labour and urged its readers to vote for the party (now led by Michael Foot), condemning the Thatcher-led Tory government for its "waste of our nation",<ref name="century"/> condemning the rise in unemployment that Thatcher's Conservative government had seen in its first term in power largely due to Monetarism|monetarist economic policies to reduce inflation, though the government's previously low popularity had dramatically improved since the success of the Falklands War|Falklands conflict a year earlier.<ref>cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393313.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=1983: Thatcher triumphs again |date=5 April 2005</ref> However, the Tories were re-elected and Labour suffered its worst postwar general election result, only narrowly bettering the SDP-Liberal Alliance in terms of votes, though winning considerably more seats.<ref name="century"/>

At the United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election, the ''Daily Mirror'' remained loyal to Labour (now led by Neil Kinnock) and urged its readers "You know he's right, chuck her out".<ref name="century"/> By this stage, unemployment was falling and inflation had remained low for several years.<ref>cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393315.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=1987: Thatcher's third victory |date=5 April 2005</ref> However, the Tories were re-elected for a third successive term, although Labour did cut the Tory majority slightly.<ref name="century"/>

For the United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election, the ''Daily Mirror'' continued to support Labour, still led by Neil Kinnock. By this stage Margaret Thatcher had stepped down and the Tory government was now led by John Major.<ref name="century"/> The election was won by the Tories, although Labour managed to significantly cut the Tory majority to 21 seats compared to the triple-digit figure of the previous two elections, which led to a difficult term for Major. The outcome of this election had been far less predictable than any of the previous three elections, as opinion polls over the previous three years had shown both parties in the lead, although any Labour lead in the polls had been relatively narrow since the Conservative government's change of leader from Thatcher to Major in November 1990, in spite of the onset of a Early 1990s recession|recession in 1990 which had pushed unemployment up again after several years of decline. Labour's credibility was helped by plans including extra National Health Service|NHS funding and moving away from firm commitments on re-nationalisation to reverse the Conservative policy of privatisation, but its decision to be up-front about tax increases was seen as a key factor in its failure to win.<ref>cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393317.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=1992: Tories win again against odds |date=5 April 2005</ref>

By the time of the United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election, support for the Labour Party, now led by Tony Blair, in the opinion polls had exceeded that of support for the Tory government (still led by John Major) since late 1992, the government's reduced popularity largely blamed on the failings of Black Wednesday in September of that year and it had failed to recover popularity in spite of a strong economic recovery and fall in unemployment. A reinvented "New Labour" had further improved its credibility under Blair by promising traditional Labour essentials including more funding for healthcare and education, but also promising not to increase income tax and ending its commitment to the nationalisation of leading industries.<ref>cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=1997: Labour landslide ends Tory rule |date=15 April 2005</ref> The ''Daily Mirror'' urged its readers that their country needed Tony Blair, and to vote Labour.<ref name="century"/> The election produced a Labour landslide and ended the party's 18-year exile from power.

On 4 May 2010, the newspaper printed a picture of Conservative leader David Cameron with a giant red cross through his face. The headline read "How to stop him" in reference to the United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election two days later, thus confirming the ''Daily Mirror'''s Labour allegiance.
