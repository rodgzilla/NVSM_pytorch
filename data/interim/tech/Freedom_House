According to its website, Freedom House "emerged from an amalgamation of two groups that had been formed, with the quiet encouragement of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to encourage popular support for American involvement in World War II at a time when isolationist sentiments were running high in the United States."<ref name="history" /> Several groups, in fact, were aggressively supporting U.S. entry into the war and in early autumn 1941, when various group activities began to overlap, the Fight for Freedom Committee began exploring a mass merger. George Field then conceived the idea of all of the groups maintaining their separate identities under one roof—Freedom House—to promote the concrete application of the principles of freedom.<ref name="McAleer"/>Rp|293

Since 1972 (1978 in book form), Freedom House publishes an annual report, ''Freedom in the World'', on the degree of democratic freedoms in nations and significant disputed territories around the world, by which it seeks to assess<ref name="usedby">[https://web.archive.org/web/20030521095112/http://polisci.la.psu.edu/faculty/Casper/caspertufisPAweb.pdf The Limited Robustness of Empirical Findings on Democracy using Highly Correlated Datasets]</ref> the current state of civil rights|civil and Freedom (political)|political rights on a scale from 1 (most free) to 7 (least free).

Until 2003, states where the average for political and civil liberties differed from 1.0 to 2.5 were considered "free". States with values from 3.0 to 5.5 were considered "partly free" and those with values between 5.5 and 7.0 as "not free". Since 2003 the scope of the "partly free" ranges from 3.0 to 5.0, "not free" from 5.5 to 7.0.

These reports are often<ref>[http://www.csa.com/csaillumina/login.php Illumnia Login] The political science journal database Illumina lists between 10 and 20 peer reviewed journal articles referencing the "freedom in the world" report each year</ref> used by list of political scientists|political scientists when doing research. The ranking is highly correlated with several other ratings of democracy also frequently used by researchers.<ref name="usedby"/>

In its 2003 report, for example, the United Kingdom (judged as fully free and democratic) got a perfect score of a "1" in civil liberties and a "1" in political rights, earning it the designation of "free." Nigeria got a "5" and a "4," earning it the designation of "partly free," while North Korea scored the lowest rank of "7-7," and was thus dubbed "not free." Nations are scored from 0 to 4 on several questions and the sum determines the rankings. Example questions: "Is the head of state and/or head of government or other chief authority elected  through free and fair elections?", "Is there an independent judiciary?", "Are there free trade unions and peasant organizations or equivalents, and is there effective collective bargaining? Are there free professional and other private organizations?"<ref name="methodology">[http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world-2005/methodology Methodology]</ref> Freedom House states that the rights and liberties of the survey are derived in large measure from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<ref name="methodology" />

The research and ratings process involved two dozen analysts and more than a dozen senior-level academic advisors. The eight members of the core research team headquartered in New York, along with 16 outside consultant analysts, prepared the country and territory reports. The analysts used a broad range of sources of information—including foreign and domestic news reports, academic analyses, nongovernmental organizations, think tanks, individual professional contacts, and visits to the region—in preparing the reports.<ref name=FHMeth>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2006 Freedom House Methodology]</ref>

The country and territory ratings were proposed by the analyst responsible for each related report. The ratings were reviewed individually and on a comparative basis in a series of six regional meetings—Asia-Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Western Europe—involving the analysts, academic advisors with expertise in each region, and Freedom House staff. The ratings were compared to the previous year's findings, and any major proposed numerical shifts or category changes were subjected to more intensive scrutiny. These reviews were followed by cross-regional assessments in which efforts were made to ensure comparability and consistency in the findings. Many of the key country reports were also reviewed by the academic advisers.<ref name=FHMeth />

The survey's methodology is reviewed periodically by an advisory committee of political scientists with expertise in methodological issues.<ref name=FHMeth />

Freedom House also produces annual reports on press freedom (''Press Freedom Survey''), governance in the nations of the former Soviet Union (''Nations in Transit''), and countries on the borderline of democracy (''Countries at the Crossroads''). In addition, one-time reports have included a survey of women's freedoms in the Middle East.

Freedom House's methods (around 1990) and other democracy-researchers were mentioned as examples of an expert-based evaluation by sociologist Kenneth A. Bollen, who is also an applied statistics|applied statistician. Bollen writes that expert-based evaluations are prone to statistical bias of an unknown direction, that is, not known either to agree with U.S. policy or to disagree with U.S. policy: "Regardless of the direction of distortions, it is highly likely that every set of indicators formed by a single author or organization contains systematic measurement error.  The origin of this measure lies in the common methodology of forming measures.

Main|Freedom of the Press (report)

The ''Freedom of the Press'' index is an annual survey of media independence that assesses the degree of print, broadcast, and internet freedom throughout the world.<ref name=FHFOTPR>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-press "Freedom of the Press"], web page, Freedom House. Retrieved May 29, 2011</ref> It provides numerical rankings and rates each country's media as "Free," "Partly Free," or "Not Free." Individual country narratives examine the legal environment for the media, political pressures that influence reporting, and economic factors that affect access to information.

The annual survey, which provides analytical reports and numerical ratings for 196 countries and territories in 2011, continues a process conducted since 1980. The findings are widely used by governments, international organizations, academics, and the news media in many countries. Countries are given a total score from 0 (best) to 100 (worst) on the basis of a set of 23 methodology questions divided into three subcategories: legal environment, political environment, and the economic environment. Assigning numerical points allows for comparative analysis among the countries surveyed and facilitates an examination of trends over time. Countries scoring 0 to 30 are regarded as having "Free" media; 31 to 60, "Partly Free" media; and 61 to 100, "Not Free" media. The ratings and reports included in each annual report cover events that took place during the previous year, for example ''Freedom of the Press 2011'' covers events that took place between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2010.<ref name=FOP-Methodology-2011/>

The study is based on universal criteria and recognizes cultural differences, diverse national interests, and varying levels of economic development. The starting point is the smallest, most universal unit of concern: the individual. The survey uses a multilayered process of analysis and evaluation by a team of regional experts and scholars, including an internal research team and external consultants. The diverse nature of the methodology questions seeks to encompass the varied ways in which pressure can be placed upon the flow of information and the ability of print, broadcast, and internet-based media to operate freely and without fear of repercussions. The report provides a picture of the entire "enabling environment" in which the media in each country operate. Degree of news and information diversity available to the public is also addressed.<ref name=FOP-Methodology-2011>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press-2011/methodology ''Freedom of the Press 2011'' – Methodology"], Karin Karlekar, Freedom House, April 15, 2011, 4 pp.</ref>

An independent review of press freedom studies, commissioned by the Knight Foundation in 2006, found that FOP is the best in its class of Press Freedom Indicators.<ref>[http://gaz.sagepub.com/content/69/1/5.abstract "An Evaluation of Press Freedom Indicators"], Lee B. Becker, Tudor Vlad and, Nancy Nusser, ''International Communication Gazette'', vol.69, no.1 (February 2007), pp. 5–28</ref>

=''Freedom on the Net''=
The ''Freedom on the Net'' reports provide analytical reports and numerical ratings regarding the state of Digital rights|Internet freedom for countries worldwide.<ref name=FOTN-2009/> The countries surveyed represent a sample with a broad range of geographical diversity and levels of economic development, as well as varying levels of political and media freedom. The surveys ask a set of questions designed to measure each country's level of Internet and digital media freedom, as well as the access and openness of other digital means of transmitting information, particularly mobile phones and text messaging services. Results are presented for three areas: 
* Obstacles to Access: infrastructural and economic barriers to access; governmental efforts to block specific applications or technologies; legal and ownership control over internet and mobile phone access providers.
* Limits on Content: filtering and blocking of websites; other forms of censorship and self-censorship; manipulation of content; the diversity of online news media; and usage of digital media for social and political activism.
* Violations of User Rights: legal protections and restrictions on online activity; surveillance and limits on privacy; and repercussions for online activity, such as legal prosecution, imprisonment, physical attacks, or other forms of harassment.
The results from the three areas are combined into a total score for a country (from 0 for best to 100 for worst) and countries are rated as "Free" (0 to 30), "Partly Free" (31 to 60), or "Not Free" (61 to 100) based on the totals.

Other activities
In addition to these reports, Freedom House participates in advocacy initiatives, currently focused on North Korea, Africa, and religious freedom. It has offices in a number of countries, where it promotes and assists local human rights workers and non-government organizations.

On January 12, 2006, as part of a crackdown on unauthorized nongovernmental organizations, the Uzbek government ordered Freedom House to suspend operations in Uzbekistan. Resource and Information Centers managed by Freedom House in Tashkent, Namangan, and Samarkand offered access to materials and books on human rights, as well as technical equipment, such as computers, copiers and Internet access. The government warned that criminal proceedings could be brought against Uzbek staff members and visitors following recent amendments to the criminal code and Code on Administrative Liability of Uzbekistan. Other human rights groups have been similarly threatened and obliged to suspend operations.

Freedom House is a member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange, a global network of more than 80 non-governmental organizations that monitors free expression violations around the world and defends journalists, writers and others who are persecuted for exercising their right to freedom of expression. Freedom House also publishes the ''China Media Bulletin'', a weekly analysis on press freedom in and related to the People's Republic of China. On 27 August 2013, Freedom House released their official iPhone app, which was created by British entrepreneur Joshua Browder.<ref>cite web|title=Freedom at your Fingertips: Freedom House Releases iPhone App|url=https://freedomhouse.org/article/freedom-your-fingertips-freedom-house-releases-iphone-app|accessdate=11 January 2016</ref>

Criticism

= Relationship with the U.S. Government =
In 2006, the ''Financial Times'' reported that Freedom House received funding by the State Department for 'clandestine activities' inside Iran.<ref name="debate">cite web|url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/48d26298-c052-11da-939f-0000779e2340,_i_rssPage=de095590-c8f4-11d7-81c6-0820abe49a01.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150506165937/http://news.ft.com/cms/s/48d26298-c052-11da-939f-0000779e2340,_i_rssPage=de095590-c8f4-11d7-81c6-0820abe49a01.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 6, 2015|title=Bush enters debate on freedom in Iran|date=March 31, 2006|author=Guy Dinmore|work=The Financial Times|accessdate=April 6, 2006subscription required</ref> According to the ''Financial Times'', "Some academics, activists and those involved in the growing US business of spreading freedom and democracy are alarmed that such semi-covert activities risk damaging the public and transparent work of other organisations, and will backfire inside Iran."<ref name="debate" />

On December 7, 2004, former United States House of Representatives|U.S. House Representative and Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian politician Ron Paul criticized Freedom House for allegedly administering a U.S.-funded program in Ukraine where "much of that money was targeted to assist one particular candidate." Paul said that

<blockquote>one part that we do know thus far is that the U.S. government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), granted millions of dollars to the Poland-America-Ukraine Cooperation Initiative (PAUCI), which is administered by the U.S.-based Freedom House. PAUCI then sent U.S. Government funds to numerous Ukrainian non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This would be bad enough and would in itself constitute meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation. But, what is worse is that many of these grantee organizations in Ukraine are blatantly in favor of presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko.<ref>cite web|url=http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=217&Itemid=60|title=U.S. Hypocrisy in Ukraine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212002804/http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=217&Itemid=60|archive-date=2012-12-12|author=Ron Paul</ref></blockquote>

Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman have criticized the organization for excessively criticizing states opposed to US interests while being unduly sympathetic to regimes supportive of US interests.<ref name="ManConP28">Chomsky and Herman: Manufacturing Consent, Vintage 1994, p. 28</ref> For example, Freedom House described the Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, 1979|Rhodesian general election of 1979 as "fair", but described the Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|Southern Rhodesian 1980 elections as "dubious",<ref name="ManConP28" /> and it found Salvadoran presidential election, 1982|El Salvador's 1982 election to be "admirable".<ref name="ManConP28" />

=Cuban, Sudanese and Chinese criticism=
In May 2001, the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations of the United Nations heard arguments for and against Freedom House. Representatives of Cuba said that the organization is a U.S. foreign policy instrument linked to the CIA and "submitted proof of the politically motivated, interventionist activities the NGO (Freedom House) carried out against their Government". They also claimed a lack of criticism of U.S. human rights violations in the annual reports. Cuba also stated that these violations are well documented by other reports, such as those of Human Rights Watch. Other countries such as People's Republic of China|China and Sudan also gave criticism. The Russian representative inquired "why this organization, an NGO which defended human rights, was against the creation of the International Criminal Court?."<ref name="UNNGOS"/>

The U.S. representative stated that alleged links between Freedom House and the CIA were "simply not true." The representative said he agreed that the NGO receives funds from the United States Government, but said this is disclosed in its reports. The representative said the funds were from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was not a branch of the CIA. The representative said his country had a law prohibiting the government from engaging in the activities of organizations seeking to change public policy, such as Freedom House. The representative said his country was not immune from criticism from Freedom House, which he said was well documented. The US representative further argued that Freedom House was a human rights organization which sought to represent those who did not have a voice. The representative said he would continue to support NGOs who criticized his government and those of others.<ref name="UNNGOS">[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/ngo432.doc.htm UN: NGO Committee hears arguments for, against Freedom House]</ref>

=Russia=
Russia, identified by Freedom House as "Not Free", called Freedom House biased and accused the group of serving U.S. interests. Sergei Markov, an MP from the United Russia party, called Freedom House a "Russophobic" organization: "You can listen to everything they say, except when it comes to Russia ... There are many Russophobes there".<ref name=MTimes>[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2008/01/17/011.html Freedom Is Downgraded From 'Bad']</ref> In response, Christopher Walker, director of studies at Freedom House, argued that Freedom House made its evaluations based on objective criteria explained on the organization's web site, and he denied that it had a pro-U.S. agenda. "If you look closely at the 193 countries that we evaluate, you'll find that we criticize what are often considered strategic allies of the United States," he said.<ref name=MTimes />

Daniel Treisman, a UCLA political scientist, has criticized Freedom House's assessment of Russia. Treisman has pointed out that Freedom House ranks Russia's political rights on the same level as the United Arab Emirates, which, according to Freedom House, is a federation of absolute monarchies with no hint of democracy anywhere in the system. Freedom House also ranks Russia's civil liberties on the same scale as those of Yemen. In Yemen, according to the constitution, Sharia law is the only source of legislation, and allows assaults and killings of women for alleged immoral behaviour. Criticising the president is illegal in Yemen. Treisman contrasts Freedom House's ranking with the Polity IV scale used by academics and in which Russia has a much better score. In the Polity IV scale, Saudi Arabia is a consolidated autocracy (-10), while the United States is a consolidated democracy (+10); Russia has a score of +5, while United Arab Emirates has a score of -8.<ref name="treisman">cite book|title=The Return: Russia's Journey from Gorbachev to Medvedev|last=Treisman|first=Daniel|publisher=Free Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4165-6071-5|pages=341–52</ref>

=Alleged partiality toward Uzbekistan=
Craig Murray, the British ambassador to Uzbekistan from 2002 to 2004, wrote that the executive director of Freedom House told him in 2003 that the group decided to back off from its efforts to spotlight human rights abuses in Uzbekistan, because some Republican board members (in Murray's words) "expressed concern that Freedom House was failing to keep in sight the need to promote freedom in the widest sense, by giving full support to U.S. and coalition forces". Human rights abuses in Uzbekistan at the time included the killing of prisoners  by "immersion in boiling liquid," and by strapping on a gas mask and blocking the filters, Murray reported.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/books/review/McKelvey2-t.html Glorious Nation of Uzbekistan], By Tara McKelvey, New York Times Book Review, December 9, 2007.

Freedom House has been a consistent and harsh critic of the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, as clearly demonstrated in press releases and in our annual assessments of that country".<ref>cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/books/review/Letters-t.html?_r=1 |title=Freedom House's Record |author=Jennifer Windsor |date=December 23, 2007 |work=The New York Times |archivedate=October 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BPwn8mTC?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/books/review/Letters-t.html?_r=2& |accessdate=October 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= </ref>

= Overemphasis on formal aspects of democracy =
According to one study, Freedom House's rankings "overemphasize the more formal aspects of democracy while failing to capture the informal but real power relations and pathways of influence ... and frequently lead to de facto deviations from democracy."<ref name=":0">Cite journal|last=Veenendaal|first=Wouter P.|date=2015-01-02|title=Democracy in microstates: why smallness does not produce a democratic political system|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2013.820710|journal=Democratization|volume=22|issue=1|pages=92–112|doi=10.1080/13510347.2013.820710|issn=1351-0347</ref> States can therefore "look formally liberal-democratic but might be rather illiberal in their actual workings".<ref name=":0" />

Chronology of systematic evaluations
From the 1970s until 1990, Raymond Gastil|Raymond&nbsp;D. Gastil practically produced the reports on his own, though sometimes with help from his wife. Gastil himself described it in 1990 as "a loose, intuitive rating system for levels of freedom or democracy, as defined by the traditional political rights and civil liberties of the Western democracies." Regarding criticisms of his reports, he said: "generally such criticism is based on opinions about Freedom House rather than detailed examination of survey ratings".<ref>Cite journal | last1 = Gastil | first1 = R. D. | doi = 10.1007/BF02716904 | title = The Comparative Survey of Freedom: Experiences and Suggestions | journal = Studies in Comparative International Development | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 25–50 | year = 1990 | pmid =  | pmc = </ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/07/why-do-we-trust-certain-democracy-ratings-new-research-explains-hidden-biases/]</ref>

In a 1986 report on the methodology used by Gastil and others to create ''Freedom in the World'' report, Kenneth A. Bollen noted some bias but found that "no criticisms of which I am aware have demonstrated a systematic bias in all the ratings. Most of the evidence consists of anecdotal evidence of relatively few cases. Whether there is a systematic or sporadic slant in Gastil's ratings is an open question".<ref name="Bollen">Bollen, K.A., [https://www.jstor.org/pss/762193 "Political Rights and Political Liberties in Nations: An Evaluation of Human Rights Measures, 1950 to 1984"], ''Human Rights Quarterly'', vol. 8, no. 4 (November 1986), pp. 567–91.

In 2001, a study by Mainwaring, Brink, and Perez-Linanhe found the Freedom Index of ''Freedom in the World'' to have a strong positive correlation (at least 80%) with three other democracy indices. Mainwaring ''et al.'' wrote that Freedom House's index had "two systematic biases: scores for leftist were tainted by political considerations,how|date=November 2017 and changes in scores are sometimes driven by changes in their criteria rather than changes in real conditions". Nonetheless, when evaluated on Latin American countries yearly, Freedom House's index was positively correlated with the index of Adam Przeworski and with the index of the authors themselves.<ref name="springerlink.com">Cite journal | last1 = Mainwaring | first1 = S. | last2 = Brinks | first2 = D. | last3 = Pérez-Liñán | first3 = A.

He gave the following example: In the United States, citizens are free to form political parties and to vote, yet even in presidential elections only half of U.S. citizens vote; in the U.S., "the same two parties speak in a commercially sponsored unison".<ref name="AP03">

A 2014 report by comparative politics researcher Nils D. Steiner found "strong and consistent evidence of a substantial bias in the FH ratings" before 1988, with bias being reflected by the relationships between the US and the countries under investigation. He writes that after 1989 the findings weren't as strong, but still hinted at political bias.<ref>Steiner, N. D. (2016).

Sarah Sunn Bush was critical of Freedom House in 2017, writing that many critics found the original pre-1990 methodology lacking. While this improved after a team was hired in 1990, she says some criticism remains. As for why the Freedom House index is most often quoted in the United States, she notes that its definition of democracy is closely aligned with US foreign policy. US-allied countries tend to get better scores than in other reports. However, because the report is important to US lawmakers and politicians, weaker states seeking US aid or favor are forced to respond to the reports, giving the Freedom House significant influence in those places. Bush shows in her report that its ideology has long reflected that of the people who are most involved in US foreign policy, and that liberal democracy was the main form of democracy that was considered. The FITW index focuses primarily on individual freedoms, as US politicians do, but little on egalitarian concerns. The claim that American politics play a role is supported by the relatively low FITW scores given to Russia and other post-Soviet states since the end of the Cold War, as well as to Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistan-led Nicaragua, but relatively high scores to the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador|El Salvador military junta. At the same time, Bush found that the House's archive showed that they never debated marking Israel as anything less than "free" despite calls from many sources in the region to do so.<ref>Bush, S.

Recognition
Former US President Bill Clinton, giving a speech at a Freedom House breakfast, said: 

<blockquote>I'm honored to be here with all of you and to be here at Freedom House. For more than 50 years, Freedom House has been a voice for tolerance for human dignity. People all over the world are better off because of your work. And I'm very grateful that Freedom House has rallied this diverse and dynamic group. It's not every day that the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|Carnegie Endowment, the Progressive Policy Institute, The Heritage Foundation, and the American Foreign Policy Council share the same masthead.<ref>[http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20111208143543/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2889/is_n40_v31/ai_18009477/ Remarks at a Freedom House breakfast - President Bill Clinton speech]</ref></blockquote>

Speaking at a reception hosted by Freedom House to honor human rights defenders, United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative Jim McGovern (American politician)|Jim McGovern said:

<blockquote>I want to thank Freedom House for all the incredible work that they do to assist human rights defenders around the world. We rely a lot on Freedom House not only for information, advice and counsel, but also for their testimony when we do our hearings. And I'm a big fan.<ref>[http://www.freedomhouse.org/article/mcgovern-praises-unsung-heroes McGovern praises 'unsung heroes', April 19, 2012]</ref></blockquote>

Speaking at a screening of film ''The Magnitsky Files'', Senator John McCain said:

<blockquote> Thank you for everything that Freedom House continues to do on behalf of people around the world who suffer oppression and persecution. I'm honored to have known you and to have the opportunity to work with you around the world ... We rely on organizations like Freedom House to make judgments about corruption and the persecution of minorities ...<ref>YouTube|hU3dzfxQbY4|June 26, 2012</ref></blockquote>

Writing in the conservative National Review|''National Review'' Online, John R. Miller states:

<blockquote>Freedom House has unwaveringly raised the standard of freedom in evaluating fascist countries, Communist regimes, and plain old, dictatorial thugocracies. Its annual rankings are read and used in the United Nations and other international organizations, as well as by the U.S. State Department. Policy and aid decisions are influenced by Freedom House's report. Those fighting for freedom in countries lacking it are encouraged or discouraged by what Freedom House's report covers. And sometimes—most importantly—their governments are moved to greater effort.<ref name=jrm>Miller, John R., "[http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=ZmVmZDg5MmM5ODBmM2YyNzM3NTMwZjBjNGQxNDhjMTE= Does 'Freedom' Mean Freedom From Slavery?

Miller nevertheless criticized the organization in 2007 as not paying enough attention to slavery in its reports. He wrote that repressive regimes,  and even democracies such as Germany and India, needed to be held to account for their lack of enforcement of laws against human trafficking and the bondage of some foreign workers.<ref name=jrm/>
