Computer and network surveillance is the monitoring of computer activity and data stored on a hard drive, or data being transferred over computer networks such as the Internet. The monitoring is often carried out covertly and may be completed by governments, corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent government agencies.

Computer and network surveillance programs are widespread today and almost all Internet traffic can be monitored.<ref>cite web | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/fbi-wants-widespread-monitoring-of-illegal-internet-activity/ | title=FBI wants widespread monitoring of 'illegal' Internet activity | work=CNET | accessdate=25 March 2014 | author=Anne Broache</ref>

Surveillance allows governments and other agencies to maintain social control, recognize and monitor threats, and prevent and investigate criminal activity. With the advent of programs such as the Total Information Awareness program, technologies such as NarusInsight|high-speed surveillance computers and Surveillance#Biometric|biometrics software, and laws such as the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.<ref name="us-surveillance-soc">cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/privacy/gen/index.html|title=Is the U.S. Turning Into a Surveillance Society?|work=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=March 13, 2009</ref>

However, many civil rights and privacy groups, such as Reporters Without Borders, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the American Civil Liberties Union, have expressed concern that with increasing surveillance of citizens we will end up in or are even already in a mass surveillance society, with limited political and/or personal freedoms. Such fear has led to numerous lawsuits such as ''Hepting v.

Packet capture (also known as "packet sniffing") is the monitoring of data traffic on a computer network.<ref>cite book|title=Law of Internet Security and Privacy|author=Kevin J. Connolly|page=131|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7355-4273-0|publisher=Aspen Publishers</ref> Data sent between computers over the Internet or between any networks takes the form of small chunks called packets, which are routed to their destination and assembled back into a complete message. A Packet Capture Appliance intercepts these packets, so that they may be examined and analyzed. Computer technology is needed to perform traffic analysis and sift through intercepted data to look for important/useful information. Under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install such packet capture technology so that Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies are able to intercept all of their customers' broadband Internet and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) traffic.<ref>[http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf American Council on Education vs. FCC] webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907032500/http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf |date=2012-09-07 , Decision, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 9 June 2006. Retrieved 8 September 2013.</ref>

There is far too much data gathered by these packet sniffers for human investigators to manually search through. Thus, automated Internet surveillance computers sift through the vast amount of intercepted Internet traffic, filtering out, and reporting to investigators those bits of information which are "interesting", for example, the use of certain words or phrases, visiting certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or chat with a certain individual or group.<ref name="usatoday-chatroom">cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|title=Government funds chat room surveillance research|last=Hill|first=Michael|date=October 11, 2004|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2009-03-19</ref> Billions of dollars per year are spent by agencies such as the Information Awareness Office, NSA, and the FBI, for the development, purchase, implementation, and operation of systems which intercept and analyze this data, extracting only the information that is useful to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.<ref name="zdnet-fbi">cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/fbi-turns-to-broad-new-wiretap-method/151059|title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=January 30, 2007|work=ZDNet News|accessdate=2009-03-13</ref>

The Internet's rapid development has become a primary form of communication. More people are potentially subject to Internet surveillance. There are advantages and disadvantages to network monitoring. For instance, systems described as "Web 2.0"<ref name="Reilly, T. 2005">O'Reilly, T. (2005). What is Web 2.0: Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software. O’Reilly Media, 1-5.</ref> have greatly impacted modern society. Tim O’ Reilly, who first explained the concept of "Web 2.0",<ref name="Reilly, T. 2005"/> stated that Web 2.0 provides communication platforms that are "user generated", with self-produced content, motivating more people to communicate with friends online.<ref>Fuchs, C. (2011). New Media, Web 2.0 and Surveillance. Sociology Compass, 134-147.</ref> However, Internet surveillance also has a disadvantage. One researcher from Uppsala University said "Web 2.0 surveillance is directed at large user groups who help to hegemonically produce and reproduce surveillance by providing user-generated (self-produced) content. We can characterize Web 2.0 surveillance as mass self-surveillance".<ref>Fuchs, C. (2011). Web 2.0, Presumption, and Surveillance. Surveillance & Society, 289-309.</ref> Surveillance companies monitor people while they are focused on work or entertainment. Yet, employers themselves also monitor their employees. They do so in order to protect the company's assets and to control public communications but most importantly, to make sure that their employees are actively working and being productive.<ref>Cite journal|last=Anthony Denise, Celeste Campos-Castillo, Christine Horne|first=|date=2017|title=Toward a Sociology of Privacy|url=|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=43|pages=249–269|via=</ref> This can emotionally affect people; this is because it can cause emotions like jealousy. A research group states "...we set out to test the prediction that feelings of jealousy lead to ‘creeping’ on a partner through Facebook, and that women are particularly likely to engage in partner monitoring in response to jealousy".<ref>Muise, A., Christofides, E., & Demsmarais, S. (2014). " Creeping" or just information seeking? Gender differences in partner monitoring in response to jealousy on Facebook. Personal Relationships, 21(1), 35-50.</ref> The study shows that women can become jealous of other people when they are in an online group.

The Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual assistant has become a social integration into lives. Currently, virtual assistant such as Amazon's Alexa cannot call 911 or local services.<ref name="How Stuff Works">Cite web|url=electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/should-smart-devices-automatically-call-cops.htm|title=How Stuff Works|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 10, 2017</ref> They are constantly listening for a command and recording parts of conversations that will help improve algorithms.

Corporate surveillance
See also |Computer surveillance in the workplace

Corporate surveillance of computer activity is very common. The data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations, but is also regularly shared with government agencies. It can be used as a form of business intelligence, which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and/or services to be desirable by their customers. The data can be also sold to other corporations so that they can use it for the aforementioned purpose, or it can be used for direct marketing purposes, such as targeted advertisements, where ads are targeted to the user of the search engine by analyzing their search history and emails<ref name="nytimes-onlineads">cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/technology/01Privacy.html?_r=1|title=F.T.C. to Review Online Ads and Privacy|last=Story|first=Louise|date=November 1, 2007|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-17</ref> (if they use free webmail services), which are kept in a database.<ref name="surv-in-society"/>

One important component of prevention is establishing the business purposes of monitoring, which may include the following:
* Preventing misuse of resources. Companies can discourage unproductive personal activities such as online shopping or web surfing on company time. Monitoring employee performance is one way to reduce unnecessary network traffic and reduce the consumption of network bandwidth.
* Promoting adherence to policies. Online surveillance is one means of verifying employee observance of company networking policies.
* Preventing lawsuits. Firms can be held liable for discrimination or employee harassment in the workplace. Organizations can also be involved in infringement suits through employees that distribute copyrighted material over corporate networks.
* Safeguarding records. Federal legislation requires organizations to protect personal information. Monitoring can determine the extent of compliance with company policies and programs overseeing information security. Monitoring may also deter unlawful appropriation of personal information, and potential spam or viruses.
* Safeguarding company assets. The protection of intellectual property, trade secrets, and business strategies is a major concern. The ease of information transmission and storage makes it imperative to monitor employee actions as part of a broader policy.
A second component of prevention is determining the ownership of technology resources. The ownership of the firm's networks, servers, computers, files, and e-mail should be explicitly stated. There should be a distinction between an employee's personal electronic devices, which should be limited and proscribed, and those owned by the firm.

For instance, Google search stores identifying information for each web search. An IP address and the search phrase used are stored in a database for up to 18 months.<ref name="cnet-googlelogs">cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13739_3-10038963-46.html|title=Debunking Google's log anonymization propaganda|last=Soghoian|first=Chris|date=September 11, 2008|work=CNET News|accessdate=2009-03-21</ref> Google also scans the content of emails of users of its Gmail webmail service in order to create targeted advertising based on what people are talking about in their personal email correspondences.<ref name="joshi">cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/every-move-you-make-google-will-be-watching-you/57071/on|title=  Every move you make, Google will be watching you|last=Joshi|first=Priyanki|date=March 21, 2009|work=Business Standard|accessdate=2009-03-21</ref> Google is, by far, the largest Internet advertising agency—millions of sites place Google's advertising banners and links on their websites in order to earn money from visitors who click on the ads.

The United States government often gains access to these databases, either by producing a warrant for it, or by simply asking. The Department of Homeland Security has openly stated that it uses data collected from consumer credit and direct marketing agencies for augmenting the profiles of individuals that it is monitoring.<ref name="surv-in-society">cite news|url=http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/observer/story.html?id=ade6d795-4e7a-4ede-9fc1-f7bf929849c8&p=1|title=Are we addicted to being watched?|last=Butler|first=Don|date=January 31, 2009|work=The Ottawa Citizen|publisher=canada.com|accessdate=26 May 2013</ref>

Malicious software
Further|Spyware|Computer virus|Trojan (computer security)|Keylogger|Backdoor (computing)

In addition to monitoring information sent over a computer network, there is also a way to examine data stored on a computer's hard drive, and to monitor the activities of a person using the computer. A surveillance program installed on a computer can search the contents of the hard drive for suspicious data, can monitor computer use, collect passwords, and/or report back activities in real-time to its operator through the Internet connection.<ref name=FTC2005>[http://www.ftc.gov/os/2005/03/050307spywarerpt.pdf "Spyware Workshop: Monitoring Software on Your OC: Spywae, Adware, and Other Software"], Staff Report, U.S. Federal Trade Commission, March 2005. Retrieved 7 September 2013.</ref> Keylogger is an example of this type of program. Normal keylogging programs store their data on the local hard drive, but some are programmed to automatically transmit data over the network to a remote computer or Web server.

There are multiple ways of installing such software. The most common is remote installation, using a Backdoor (computing)|backdoor created by a computer virus or Trojan (computer security)|trojan. This tactic has the advantage of potentially subjecting multiple computers to surveillance.  Viruses often spread to thousands or millions of computers, and leave "backdoors" which are accessible over a network connection, and enable an intruder to remotely install software and execute commands. These viruses and trojans are sometimes developed by government agencies, such as CIPAV and Magic Lantern (software)|Magic Lantern. More often, however, viruses created by other people or spyware installed by marketing agencies can be used to gain access through the security breaches that they create.<ref>cite book|author=Aycock, John|title=Computer Viruses and Malware|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=978-0-387-30236-2|url=https://www.springer.com/computer/security+and+cryptology/book/978-0-387-30236-2</ref>

Another method is Security cracking|"cracking" into the computer to gain access over a network. An attacker can then install surveillance software remotely. Server (computing)|Servers and computers with permanent broadband connections are most vulnerable to this type of attack.<ref>[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/18/office_workers_give_away_passwords/ "Office workers give away passwords for a cheap pen"],  John Leyden, ''The Register'', 8 April 2003. Retrieved 7 September 2013.</ref> Another source of security cracking is employees giving out information or users using brute force tactics to guess their password.<ref>[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/03/03/passwords_are_passport_to_theft/ "Passwords are passport to theft"], ''The Register'', 3 March 2004. Retrieved 7 September 2013.</ref>

One can also physically place surveillance software on a computer by gaining entry to the place where the computer is stored and install it from a compact disc, floppy disk, or USB flash drive|thumbdrive.  This method shares a disadvantage with hardware devices in that it requires physical access to the computer.<ref>[http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/social-engineering-fundamentals-part-i-hacker-tactics "Social Engineering Fundamentals, Part I: Hacker Tactics"], Sarah Granger, 18 December 2001.</ref> One well-known worm that uses this method of spreading itself is Stuxnet.<ref>cite web|url=http://antivirus.about.com/od/virusdescriptions/f/How-Does-The-Stuxnet-Worm-Spread.htm |title=Stuxnet: How does the Stuxnet worm spread? |publisher=Antivirus.about.com |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-05-17</ref>

quote|''The purpose of the SSNA algorithms program is to extend techniques of social network analysis to assist with distinguishing potential terrorist cells from legitimate groups of people ... In order to be successful SSNA will require information on the social interactions of the majority of people around the globe. Since the Defense Department cannot easily distinguish between peaceful citizens and terrorists, it will be necessary for them to gather data on innocent civilians as well as on potential terrorists.''|Jason Ethier<ref name="ethier"/>

Surveillance as an aid to censorship
See also |Internet censorship |Internet censorship circumvention

Surveillance and censorship are different. Surveillance can be performed without censorship, but it is harder to engage in censorship without some form of surveillance.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/02/censorship-inseperable-from-surveillance "Censorship is inseparable from surveillance"], Cory Doctorow, ''The Guardian'', 2 March 2012</ref> And even when surveillance does not lead directly to censorship, the widespread knowledge or belief that a person, their computer, or their use of the Internet is under surveillance can lead to self-censorship.<ref>[http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/faife/publications/spotlights/1%20Bitso_Fourie_BothmaTrendsInTransiton.pdf "Trends in transition from classical censorship to Internet censorship: selected country overviews"]</ref>

In March 2013 Reporters Without Borders issued a ''Special report on Internet surveillance'' that examines the use of technology that monitors online activity and intercepts electronic communication in order to arrest journalists, citizen-journalists, and dissidents. The report includes a list of "State Enemies of the Internet", Bahrain, China, Iran, Syria, and Vietnam, countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Computer and network surveillance is on the increase in these countries. The report also includes a second list of "Corporate Enemies of the Internet", Amesys (France), Blue Coat Systems (U.S.), Gamma (UK and Germany), Hacking Team (Italy), and Trovicor (Germany), companies that sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information. Neither list is exhaustive and they are likely to be expanded in the future.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013>[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ ''The Enemies of the Internet Special Edition : Surveillance''], Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013</ref>

Protection of sources is no longer just a matter of journalistic ethics. Journalists should equip themselves with a "digital survival kit" if they are exchanging sensitive information online, storing it on a computer hard-drive or mobile phone.<ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/opinion/without-computer-security-sources-secrets-arent-safe-with-journalists.html?_r=1& "When Secrets Aren’t Safe With Journalists"], Christopher Soghoian, ''New York Times'', 26 October 2011</ref> Individuals associated with high-profile rights organizations, dissident groups, protest groups, or reform groups are urged to take extra precautions to protect their online identities.<ref name=CitizensLab-2007>[http://www.nartv.org/mirror/circ_guide.pdf ''Everyone's Guide to By-passing Internet Censorship''], The Citizen Lab, University of Toronto, September 2007</ref>
