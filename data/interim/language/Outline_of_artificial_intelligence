 What ''type'' of thing is artificial intelligence? 

* A form of intelligence
** Synthetic intelligence – intelligence of a man-made yet real quality: actual, not fake, not simulated
* A type of technology
** A type of computer technology
*** A computer system that performs some intellectual function
** An emerging technology
* A field:
** An academic discipline
** A branch of science
*** A branch of applied science
**** A branch of computer science

Types of artificial intelligence
* Weak AI (narrow AI) – non-sentient machine intelligence, typically focused on a narrow task (narrow AI).
* Artificial general intelligence|Strong AI / artificial general intelligence (AGI) – (hypothetical) machine with the ability to apply intelligence to any problem, rather than just one specific problem, typically meaning "at least as smart as a typical human". It's future potential creation is referred to as a technological singularity, and constitutes a global catastrophic risk (''see Superintelligence, below'').
* Superintelligence – (hypothetical) artificial intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. Due to recursive self-improvement, superintelligence is expected to be a rapid outcome of creating artificial general intelligence.

History of artificial intelligence

* Progress in artificial intelligence
* Timeline of artificial intelligence
* Asilomar Conference on Beneficial AI (2017)

= by region =

= by subject =

* AI effect – as soon as AI successfully solves a problem, the problem is no longer considered by the public to be a part of AI. This phenomenon has occurred in relation to every AI application produced, so far, throughout the history of development of AI. 
* AI winter – 
* GOFAI
* History of machine learning &nbsp; (Timeline of machine learning|timeline)
* History of machine translation &nbsp; (Timeline of machine translation|timeline)
* Moore's Law – observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years. One way this relates to AI is that hypothetically a computer would need at least as much capacity as a human brain to be able to be programmed to be as smart as a human.  So as long as the aforementioned rate of development met or beat the 2-year doubling time, one could roughly forecast when a computer would have as much memory and calculation capacity as a human brain, a milestone which was reached in 2010. Though it may take as much as 3 magnitudes (1000 times) more computer capacity (since computers calculate things in a much more linear fashion) to emulate the massively parallel structure of the human brain. At a doubling time of 2 years, an increase in capacity by 1000-fold would take a little less than 18 years (9 doublings), if reaching the limit of integrated circuit technology did not pose an obstacle before then.

 AI hazards and safety 
* Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence 
** Artificial intelligence as a global catastrophic risk
** AI takeover – point at which humans are no longer the dominant form of intelligence on Earth and machine intelligence is
** Intelligence explosion – through recursive self-improvement and self-replication, the magnitude of intelligent machinery could achieve superintelligence, surpassing human ability to resist it.
** Superintelligence – AI may grow to such an advanced state to become as proportionately superior to humans as humans are to ants.  Theoretically, there would be little humans could do to prevent such an intelligence from reaching its goals.
** Ethics of artificial intelligence#Weaponization of artificial intelligence|Weaponization of artificial intelligence
*** Artificial intelligence arms race &ndash; competition between two or more states to have its military forces equipped with the best "artificial intelligence" (AI).
*** Lethal autonomous weapon
*** Military robot
*** Unmanned combat aerial vehicle
* Friendly AI – hypothetical AI that is designed not to harm humans and to prevent unfriendly AI from being developed

 AI and the future 
* Artificial general intelligence (Strong AI) – hypothetical artificial intelligence that matches or exceeds human intelligence — an intelligent machine that could perform intellectual tasks at least as well as a human
** Aspects or features
*** Self-replicating machines – smart computers and robots would be able to make more of themselves, in a geometric progression or via mass production.  Or smart programs may be uploaded into hardware existing at the time (because linear architecture of sufficient speeds could be used to emulate massively parallel analog systems such as human brains).
*** Recursive self improvement (aka seed AI) – speculative ability of strong artificial intelligence to reprogram itself to make itself even more intelligent. The more intelligent it got, the more capable it would be of further improving itself, in successively more rapid iterations, potentially resulting in an intelligence explosion leading to the emergence of a superintelligence.
*** Group mind (science fiction)|Hive mind –
*** Swarm intelligence#In popular culture|Robot swarm –
** Technological singularity – the development of strong AI may cause an intelligence explosion in which greater-than-human intelligence emerges, radically changing civilization, and perhaps even human nature. The TS has been identified by Harvtxt|Berglas|2012 and others to be an existential risk.
*** Singularitarianism –
*** Human enhancement – humans may be enhanced, either by the efforts of AI or by merging with it.
**** Transhumanism – philosophy of human transformation
**** Posthumanism – people may survive, but not be recognizable in comparison to present modern-day humans.
***** Cyborgs –
***** Mind uploading –
** Intelligence explosion – through recursive self-improvement and self-replication, the magnitude of intelligent machinery could achieve superintelligence, surpassing human ability to resist it.
** Superintelligence – AI may grow to such an advanced state to become as proportionately superior to humans as humans are to ants.  Theoretically, there would be little humans could do to prevent such an intelligence from reaching its goals.
