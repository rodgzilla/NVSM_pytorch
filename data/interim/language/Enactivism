Enactivism argues that cognition arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting organism and its environment.<ref name="Evan Thompson"/> It claims that our environment is one which we selectively create through our capacities to interact with the world.<ref name=Rowlands/> "Organisms do not passively receive information from their environments, which they then translate into internal representations. Natural cognitive systems...participate in the generation of meaning ...engaging in transformational and not merely informational interactions: ''they enact a world''."<ref name=Jaegher1/> These authors suggest that the increasing emphasis upon enactive terminology presages a new era in thinking about cognitive science.<ref name=Jaegher1/> How the actions involved in enactivism relate to age-old questions about free will remains a topic of active debate.<ref name=Manetti/>

The term 'enactivism' is close in meaning to 'enaction', defined as "the manner in which a subject of perception creatively matches its actions to the requirements of its situation".<ref name=Tascano0/> The introduction of the term ''enaction'' in this context is attributed to  Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch,<ref name=Tascano0/><ref name=RWilson/> who proposed the name to "emphasize the growing conviction that cognition is not the representation of a pre-given world by a pre-given mind but is rather the enactment of a world and a mind on the basis of a history of the variety of actions that a being in the world performs".<ref name=Varela/> This was further developed by Thompson and others,<ref name="Evan Thompson"/> to place emphasis upon the idea that experience of the world is a result of mutual interaction between the sensorimotor capacities of the organism and its environment.<ref name=RWilson/>

The initial emphasis of enactivism upon sensorimotor skills has been criticized as "cognitively marginal",<ref name=ClarkA/> but it has been extended to apply to higher level cognitive activities, such as social interactions.<ref name="Jaegher1"/> "In the enactive view,... knowledge is constructed: it is constructed by an agent through its sensorimotor interactions with its environment, co-constructed between and within living species through their meaningful interaction with each other. In its most abstract form, knowledge is co-constructed between human individuals in socio-linguistic interactions...Science is a particular form of social knowledge construction...[that] allows us to perceive and predict events beyond our immediate cognitive grasp...and also to construct further, even more powerful scientific knowledge."<ref name=Rohde/>

Enactivism is closely related to situated cognition and embodied cognition, and is presented as an alternative to cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism, computationalism, and Cartesian dualism.

Philosophical aspects<!--'Enaction (philosophy)' redirects here-->

Enactivism is one of  a cluster of related theories sometimes known as the ''4Es''.<ref name=Gallagher/> As described by Mark Rowlands, mental processes are:
* Embodied involving more than the brain, including a more general involvement of bodily structures and processes.
* Embedded functioning only in a related external environment.
* Enacted involving not only neural processes, but also things an organism ''does''.
* Extended into the organism's environment.

Enactivism proposes an alternative to Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism as a philosophy of mind, in that it emphasises the interactions between mind, body and the environment, seeing them all as inseparably intertwined in mental processes.<ref name=EThompson/> The self arises as part of the process of an embodied entity interacting with the environment in precise ways determined by its physiology.   In this sense, individuals can be seen to "grow into" or arise from their interactive role with the world.<ref name=Burman/>
:"Enaction is the idea that organisms create their own experience through their actions. Organisms are not passive receivers of input from the environment, but are actors in the environment such that what they experience is shaped by how they act."<ref name=Hutchins/>

In ''The Tree of Knowledge'' Maturana & Varela proposed the term ''enactive''<ref name=Maturana/> "to evoke the view of knowledge that what is known is brought forth, in contraposition to the more classical views of either cognitivism<ref group=Note name=Cognitivism/> or connectionism.<ref group=Note name=Connectionism/> They see enactivism as providing a middle ground between the two extremes of representationalism and solipsism. They seek to "confront the problem of understanding how our existence-the Praxis (process)|praxis of our living- is coupled to a surrounding world which appears filled with regularities that are at every instant the result of our biological and social histories.... to find a ''via media'': to understand the regularity of the world we are experiencing at every moment, but without any point of reference independent of ourselves that would give certainty to our descriptions and cognitive assertions.  Indeed the whole mechanism of generating ourselves, as describers and observers tells us that our world, as the world which we bring forth in our coexistence with others, will always have precisely that mixture of regularity and mutability, that combination of solidity and shifting sand, so typical of human experience when we look at it up close."[''Tree of Knowledge'', p.&nbsp;241]

Enactivism also addresses the hard problem of consciousness, referred to by Thompson as part of the ''explanatory gap'' in explaining how consciousness and subjective experience are related to brain and body.<ref name=EThompson2/>  "The problem with the dualistic concepts of consciousness and life in standard formulations of the hard problem is that they exclude each other by construction".<ref name=EThompson3/> Instead, according to Thompson's view of enactivism, the study of consciousness or Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology as exemplified by Husserl and Merleau-Ponty is to complement science and its objectification of the world. "The whole universe of science is built upon the world as directly experienced, and if we want to subject science itself to rigorous scrutiny and arrive at a precise assessment of its meaning and scope, we must begin by reawakening the basic experience of the world of which science is the second-order expression" (Merleau-Ponty, ''The phenomenology of perception'' as quoted by Thompson, p.&nbsp;165). In this interpretation, enactivism asserts that science is formed or enacted as part of humankind's interactivity with its world, and by embracing phenomenology "science itself is properly situated in relation to the rest of human life and is thereby secured on a sounder footing."<ref name=EThompson4/><ref name=Baldwin/>

Enaction has been seen as a move to conjoin representationalism with phenomenalism, that is, as adopting a constructivist epistemology, an epistemology centered upon the active participation of the subject in constructing reality.<ref name=Mutelesi/><ref name=Chiari/> However, 'constructivism' focuses upon more than a simple 'interactivity' that could be described as a minor adjustment to 'assimilate' reality or 'accommodate' to it.<ref name=Glaserfeld/> Constructivism looks upon interactivity as a radical, creative, revisionist process in which the knower ''constructs'' a personal 'knowledge system' based upon their experience and tested by its viability in practical encounters with their environment. Learning is a result of perceived anomalies that produce dissatisfaction with existing conceptions.<ref name=Glasersfeld2/>

How does constructivism relate to enactivism? From the above remarks it can be seen that Ernst von Glasersfeld|Glasersfeld expresses an interactivity between the knower and the known quite acceptable to an enactivist, but does not emphasize  the structured probing of the environment by the knower that leads to the "perturbation relative to some expected result" that then leads to a new understanding.<ref name=Glasersfeld2/> It is this probing activity, especially where it is not accidental but deliberate, that characterizes enaction, and invokes ''affect'',<ref name=Ward2/> that is, the motivation and planning that lead to doing and to fashioning the probing, both observing and modifying the environment, so that "perceptions and nature condition one another through generating one another."<ref name=Diettrich/> The questioning nature of this probing activity is not an emphasis of Jean Piaget|Piaget and Glasersfeld.

Sharing enactivism's stress upon both action and embodiment in the incorporation of knowledge, but giving Glasersfeld's mechanism of viability an Introduction to evolution|evolutionary emphasis,<ref name=Diettrich2/> is evolutionary epistemology. Inasmuch as an organism must reflect its environment well enough for the organism to be able to survive in it, and to be competitive enough to be able to reproduce at sustainable rate, the structure and reflexes of the organism itself embody knowledge of its environment. This biology-inspired theory of the growth of knowledge is closely tied to universal Darwinism, and is associated with evolutionary epistemologists such as Karl Popper, Donald T. Campbell, Peter Munz, and Gary Cziko.<ref name=Gontier/> According to Munz, "an organism is an ''embodied theory'' about its environment... Embodied theories are also no longer expressed in language, but in anatomical structures or reflex responses, etc."<ref name=Gontier/><ref name=Munz/>

=Enactive views of perception=
In the enactive view, perception "is not conceived as the transmission of information but more as an exploration of the world by various means. Cognition is not tied into the workings of an 'inner mind', some cognitive core, but occurs in directed interaction between the body and the world it inhabits."<ref name=McGann2>

Alva Noë in advocating an enactive view of perception<ref name=Noe>

</ref> sought to resolve how we perceive three-dimensional objects, on the basis of two-dimensional input.  He argues that we perceive this solidity (or 'volumetricity') by appealing to patterns of sensorimotor expectations. These arise from our agent-active  'movements and interaction' with objects, or 'object-active' changes in the object itself. The solidity is perceived through our expectations and skills in knowing how the object's appearance would change with changes in how we relate to it. He saw all perception as an active exploration of the world, rather than being a passive process, something which happens to us.

Noë's idea of the role of 'expectations' in three-dimensional perception has been opposed by several philosophers, notably by Andy Clark.<ref name=ClarkA1/> Clark points to difficulties of the enactive approach.  He points to internal processing of visual signals, for example, in the ventral and dorsal pathways, Two-streams hypothesis|the two-streams hypothesis. This results in an integrated perception of objects (their recognition and location, respectively) yet this processing cannot be described as an action or actions. In a more general criticism, Clark suggests that perception is not a matter of expectations about sensorimotor mechanisms guiding perception. Rather, although the limitations of sensorimotor mechanisms constrain perception, this sensorimotor activity is drastically filtered to fit current needs and purposes of the organism, and it is these imposed 'expectations' that govern perception, filtering for the 'relevant' details of sensorimotor input (called "sensorimotor summarizing").<ref name=ClarkA1/>

These sensorimotor-centered and purpose-centered views appear to agree on the general scheme but disagree on the dominance issue – is the dominant component peripheral or central. Another view, the closed-loop perception one, assigns equal a-priori dominance to the peripheral and central components. In closed-loop perception, perception emerges through the process of inclusion of an item in a motor-sensory-motor loop, i.e., a loop (or loops) connecting the peripheral and central components that are relevant to that item.<ref name="AhiAssa1">Ahissar, E. and E. Assa (2016) Perception as a closed-loop convergence process. eLife 5:e12830.DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12830 </ref> The item can be a body part (in which case the loops are in steady-state) or an external object (in which case the loops are perturbed and gradually converge to a steady state). These enactive loops are always active, switching dominance by the need.

Another application of enaction to perception is analysis of the human hand. The many remarkably demanding uses of the hand are not learned by instruction, but through a history of engagements that lead to the acquisition of skills. According to one interpretation, it is suggested that "the hand [is]...an organ of cognition", not a faithful subordinate working under top-down instruction, but a partner in a "bi-directional interplay between manual and brain activity."<ref name="Hutto">

=Participatory sense-making=

Hanne De Jaegher and Ezequiel Di Paolo (2007)<ref name="DeJaeger0"/> have extended the enactive concept of sense-making<ref name="EThompson3"/> into the social domain. The idea takes as its departure point the process of interaction between individuals in a social encounter.<ref name=DeJaegher_etal>cite journal |author1=Hanne De Jaegher |author2=Ezequiel Di Paolo |author3=Shaun Gallagher |title= Can social interaction constitute social cognition? |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2010  |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=441–447 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.06.009 |pmid=20674467
</ref> De Jaegher and Di Paolo argue that the interaction process itself can take on a form of autonomy (operationally defined). This allows them to define social cognition as the generation of meaning and its transformation through interacting individuals.

The notion of participatory sense-making has led to the proposal that interaction processes can sometimes play constitutive roles in social cognition (De Jaegher, Di Paolo, Gallagher, 2010).<ref name="DeJaegher1"/> It has been applied to research in social neuroscience''<ref name="DiPaolo3"/><ref name=SchilbachTimmermans>

In a similar vein, "an inter-enactive approach to agency holds that the behavior of agents in a social situation unfolds not only according to their individual abilities and goals, but also according to the conditions and constraints imposed by the autonomous dynamics of the interaction process itself".<ref name=STorrance>

</ref> According to Torrance, enactivism involves five interlocking themes related to the question "What is it to be a (cognizing, conscious) agent?" It is:<ref name=STorrance/>
:1. to be a biologically autonomous (Autopoiesis|autopoietic) organism
:2. to generate ''significance'' or ''meaning'', rather than to act via...updated internal representations of the external world
:3. to engage in sense-making via dynamic coupling with the environment
:4. to 'enact' or 'bring forth' a world of significances by mutual co-determination of the organism with its enacted world
:5. to arrive at an experiential awareness via lived embodiment in the world.

Torrance adds that "many kinds of agency, in particular the agency of human beings, cannot be understood separately from understanding the nature of the interaction that occurs between agents." That view introduces the social applications of enactivism. "Social cognition is regarded as the result of a special form of action, namely ''social interaction''...the enactive approach looks at the circular dynamic within a dyad of embodied agents."<ref name=FuchsT>

main|Enactive interfaces
The ideas of enactivism regarding how organisms engage with their environment have interested those involved in Cognitive robotics|robotics and Human–computer interaction|man-machine interfaces. The analogy is drawn that a robot can be designed to interact and learn from its environment in a manner similar to the way an organism does that,<ref name=Sandini>

</ref> and a human can interact with a computer-aided design tool or data base using an interface that creates an enactive environment for the user, that is, all the user's tactile, auditory, and visual capabilities are enlisted in a mutually explorative engagement, capitalizing upon all the user's abilities, and not at all limited to cerebral engagement.<ref name=Bordegoni>
