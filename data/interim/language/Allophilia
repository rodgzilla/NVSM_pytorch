Allophilia is having a positive attitude towards outgroup members. The outgroup members can be anyone who possesses characteristics that are different from one's own, such as people of different Race (human categorization)|races, religions, cultures, etc. It is a framework for understanding effective intergroup leadership and is conceptualized as a measurable state of mind with tangible consequences.<ref>cite news|title= Allophilia—a new framework for understanding effective intergroup leadership|author= Todd Pittinsky|url= http://www.centerforpublicleadership.org/?option=com_content&task=emailform&id=267&itemid=2|newspaper= Center for Public Leadership, Harvard Kennedy School|date= |accessdate= 18 June 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130620034033/http://www.centerforpublicleadership.org/?option=com_content&task=emailform&id=267&itemid=2|archivedate= 20 June 2013|df= </ref><ref>cite news |title=Positive prejudice: Really loving your neighbour |author= |url= http://www.economist.com/node/8859092 |newspaper= The Economist|date= 15 March 2007 |accessdate=18 June 2013</ref>

The term "allophilia" was coined by Harvard professor Todd L. Pittinsky in 2006, after he was unable to find an antonym for prejudice in any dictionary.<ref>cite news |title=Otherly Love: The Law of Dissimilars|author= Ashley Pettus|url= http://harvardmagazine.com/2006/01/the-law-of-dissimilars.html|newspaper= Harvard Magazine |date=January 2006 |accessdate=18 June 2013</ref> The term derived from Greek language|Greek words meaning "liking or love of the other".<ref>Pittinsky, T.

Allophilia has five statistical factors:
# affection,
# comfort,
# engagement,
# enthusiasm,
# kinship.

The Allophilia Scale measures each of these factors.<ref>cite news |title=Allophilia: Beyond tolerance lies true respect|author= Sheema Khan|url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/allophilia-beyond-tolerance-lies-true-respect/article9130024/|newspaper= The Globe and Mail |date=28 February 2013 |accessdate=18 June 2013</ref><ref>Pittinsky, T.

Allophilia, Prejudice, and Positive Intergroup Relations

The typical remedy for prejudice is to bring conflicting groups into a state of tolerance. However, tolerance is not the logical antithesis of prejudice, but rather is the midpoint between negative feelings and positive feelings toward others. Allophilia enhancement should serve as complement to prejudice reduction.<ref name="ref3">Pittinsky, T. L., & Montoya, R. M. (2009). Symhedonia in intergroup relations: The relationship of empathic joy to prejudice and allophilia. Psicologia Sociale, 3, 347–364.</ref><ref>Pittinsky, T. L. (2009). Allophilia: Moving beyond tolerance in the classroom. Childhood Education, 85(4), 212–215.</ref><ref>Pittinsky, T. L. (2009). Look both ways. Phi Delta Kappan, 90(5), 363–364.</ref>

Allophilia predicts positive relationships with outgroup members. For instance, a study in Spain shows that students having higher allophilia had lower social distance toward people with obesity.<ref>Magallares, A. (2017). Predictors of Social Distance Toward People with Obesity: The Role of Allophilia. International Review of Social Psychology, 30(1).</ref> Besides, positive experience with outgroup members may increase allophilia, as it is shown in a longitudinal study of a cook's tour in Vietnam. In that study, the participants, who were Americans, reported positive feelings toward Vietnamese mirroring Allophilia facets in nearly 10 years after the event.<ref>Livert, D. (2016). A Cook's Tour Abroad: Long‐Term Effects of Intergroup Contact on Positive Outgroup Attitudes. Journal of Social Issues, 72(3), 524-547.</ref>

In one study, mudita|symhedonia (experiencing empathic joy) has been shown to be more closely associated with allophilia, while sympathy (experiencing empathic sorrow) has been shown to be more strongly associated with prejudice.<ref name="ref3"/>
