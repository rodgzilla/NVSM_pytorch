Microlinguistics is a branch of linguistics that concerns itself with the study of language systems in the abstract, without regard to the Meaning (linguistics)|meaning or notional content of linguistic expressions.  In micro-linguistics, language is reduced to the abstract mental elements of syntax and phonology.  It contrasts with macro-linguistics, which includes meanings, and especially with sociolinguistics, which studies how language and meaning function within human social systems.<ref>Citation
