about|the concept of cultural pluralism|other uses of the term|Pluralism (disambiguation)
Cultural pluralism is a term used when smaller groups within a larger society maintain their unique Cultural identity|cultural identities, and their value (personal and cultural)|values and practices are accepted by the wider culture provided they are consistent with the laws and values of the wider society. As a sociological term, the definition and description of cultural pluralism has evolved over time. It has been described as not only a fact but a societal goal.<ref>William R. Hazard and Madelon Stent, "Cultural Pluralism and Schooling: Some Preliminary Observations," Cultural Pluralism in Education: A Mandate for Change, eds. Madelon Stent, William R. Hazard and Harry N. Revlin (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1973), p. 13.</ref> Cultural pluralism is distinct from (though often confused with) multiculturalism. Multiculturalism lacks the requirement of a dominant culture. If the dominant culture is weakened, societies can easily pass from cultural pluralism into multiculturalism without any intentional steps being taken by that society. If communities function separately from each other, or compete with one another, they are not considered culturally pluralistic.<ref name=":0"/>

Cultural pluralism can be practiced at varying degrees by a group or an individual.<ref>Social and Cultural Pluralism as a Concept in Social System Analysis ;Marie R. Haug; Vol. 73, No. 3 (Nov., 1967), pp. 294-304; Published by: University of Chicago Press</ref> A prominent example of pluralism is 20th Century United States, in which a dominant culture with strong elements of nationalism, a sporting culture, and an artistic culture contained also smaller groups with their own ethnic, religious, and cultural norms Citation needed|date = July 2015. In 1971, the Canadian government referred to cultural pluralism, as opposed to multiculturalism, as the "very essence" of their nation's identity<ref>''Library and Archives Canada. Canada. Parliament. House of Commons. Debates, 28th Parliament, 3rd Session, Volume 8 (8 October 1971) ; [http://www.pier21.ca/research/immigration-history/canadian-multiculturalism-policy-1971 Canadian Multicultural Policy 1971]''</ref><sup>.</sup> In a pluralist culture, groups not only co-exist side by side, but also consider qualities of other groups as traits worth having in the dominant culture. Pluralistic societies place strong expectations of Social integration|integration on members, rather than expectations of Cultural assimilation|assimilation. The existence of such institutions and practices is possible if the cultural communities are accepted by the larger society in a pluralist culture and sometimes require the protection of the law. Often the acceptance of a culture may require that the new or minority culture remove some aspects of their culture which is incompatible with the laws or values of the dominant culture.

The idea of cultural pluralism in the United States has its roots in the transcendentalist movement and was developed by pragmatism|pragmatist philosophers such as Horace Kallen, William James and John Dewey, and later thinkers such as Randolph Bourne. One of the most famous articulations of cultural pluralistic ideas can be found in Bourne's 1916 essay "Trans-National America".<ref>Science Encyclopedia [http://science.jrank.org/pages/10750/Pluralism-Cultural-Pluralism.html Cultural Pluralism] Retrieved on May 31, 2007</ref> Philosopher Horace Kallen is widely credited as being the originator of the concept of cultural pluralism.<ref>Horace M.

In 1976, an article in the ''Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare'' offered a redefinition of cultural pluralism in which it is described as a social condition in which communities of different cultures live together and function in an open system.<ref name=":0">Pantoja, Antonia; Perry, Wilhelmina; and Blourock, Barbara (1976) "Towards the Development of Theory: Cultural Pluralism Redefined," ''The Journal of Sociology & Social Welfare'': Vol. 4: Iss. 1, Article 11.
