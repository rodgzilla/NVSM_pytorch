In mathematics, in graph theory, the Seidel adjacency matrix of a Graph (discrete mathematics)|simple undirected graph ''G'' is a symmetric matrix with a row and column for each vertex, having 0 on the diagonal, &minus;1 for positions whose rows and columns correspond to adjacent vertices, and +1 for positions corresponding to non-adjacent vertices.
It is also called the Seidel matrix or&mdash;its original name&mdash;the (&minus;1,1,0)-adjacency matrix. 
It can be interpreted as the result of subtracting the adjacency matrix of ''G'' from the adjacency matrix of the complement graph|complement of ''G''.

The multiset of eigenvalues of this matrix is called the Seidel spectrum. 

The Seidel matrix was introduced by J. H. van Lint and Johan Jacob Seidel|J. J. Seidel in 1966 and extensively exploited by Seidel and coauthors.  

The Seidel matrix of ''G'' is also the adjacency matrix of a signed graph|signed complete graph ''K<sub>G</sub>'' in which the edges of ''G'' are negative and the edges not in ''G'' are positive.  It is also the adjacency matrix of the two-graph associated with ''G'' and ''K<sub>G</sub>''.

The eigenvalue properties of the Seidel matrix are valuable in the study of strongly regular graphs.
