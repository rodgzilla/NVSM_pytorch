In combinatorics, an expander graph is a sparse graph that has strong connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity properties, quantified using vertex (graph theory)|vertex, edge (graph theory)|edge or spectral expansion as described below. Expander constructions have spawned research in pure and applied mathematics, with several applications to Computational complexity theory|complexity theory, design of robust computer networks, and the theory of error-correcting codes.<ref>harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006</ref>

Definitions
Intuitively, an expander is a finite, undirected multigraph in which every subset of the vertices that  is not "too large" has a "large" boundary. Different formalisations of these notions give rise to different notions of expanders: ''edge expanders'', ''vertex expanders'', and ''spectral expanders'', as defined below.

A disconnected graph is not an expander, since the boundary of a connected component is empty. Every connected graph is an expander; however, different connected graphs have different expansion parameters. The complete graph has the best expansion property, but it has largest possible degree. Informally, a graph is a good expander if it has low degree and high expansion parameters.

=Edge expansion=
The ''edge expansion'' (also ''isoperimetric number'' or Cheeger constant (graph theory)|Cheeger constant) ''h''(''G'') of a graph ''G'' on ''n'' vertices is defined as
: <math>h(G) = \min_{0 < |S| \le \frac{n}{2} } \frac{|\partial S|}{|S|},</math>
where <math>\partial S := \{ (u, v) \in E(G) \ : \ u \in S, v \in V(G) \setminus S \}.</math>

In the equation, the minimum is over all nonempty sets ''S'' of at most ''n''/2 vertices and ∂''S'' is the ''edge boundary'' of ''S'', i.e., the set of edges with exactly one endpoint in ''S''.<ref>Definition 2.1 in harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006</ref>

=Vertex expansion=
The ''vertex isoperimetric number'' <math>h_{\text{out(G)</math> (also ''vertex expansion'' or ''magnification'') of a graph ''G'' is defined as
: <math>h_{\text{out(G) = \min_{0 < |S|\le \frac{n}{2 \frac{|\partial_{\text{out(S)|}{|S|},</math>
where <math>\partial_{\text{out(S)</math> is the ''outer boundary'' of ''S'', i.e., the set of vertices in <math>V(G)\setminus S</math> with at least one neighbor in ''S''.<ref name="BobkovHoudre">harvtxt|Bobkov|Houdré|Tetali|2000</ref> In a variant of this definition (called ''unique neighbor expansion'') <math>\partial_{\text{out(S)</math> is replaced by the set of vertices in ''V'' with ''exactly'' one neighbor in ''S''.<ref name="AlonCapalbo">harvtxt|Alon|Capalbo|2002</ref>

The ''vertex isoperimetric number'' <math>h_{\text{in(G)</math> of a graph ''G'' is defined as
: <math>h_{\text{in(G) = \min_{0 < |S|\le \frac{n}{2 \frac{|\partial_{\text{in(S)|}{|S|},</math>
where <math>\partial_{\text{in(S)</math> is the ''inner boundary'' of ''S'', i.e., the set of vertices in ''S'' with at least one neighbor in <math>V(G)\setminus S</math>.<ref name="BobkovHoudre" />

=Spectral expansion=
When ''G'' is regular graph|''d''-regular, a linear algebraic definition of expansion is possible based on the Eigenvalue#Eigenvalues of matrices|eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix ''A'' = ''A''(''G'') of ''G'', where <math>A_{ij}</math> is the number of edges between vertices ''i'' and ''j''.<ref>cf. Section 2.3 in harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006</ref> Because ''A'' is symmetric matrix|symmetric, the spectral theorem implies that ''A'' has ''n'' real-valued eigenvalues <math>\lambda_1 \ge \lambda_2 \ge \cdots \ge \lambda_{n}</math>. It is known that all these eigenvalues are in [−''d'', ''d''].

Because ''G'' is regular, the uniform distribution <math>u\in\R^n</math> with <math>u_i=1/n</math> for all ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n'' is the stationary distribution of ''G''. That is, we have ''Au'' = ''du'', and ''u'' is an eigenvector of ''A'' with eigenvalue λ<sub>1</sub> = ''d'', where ''d'' is the degree (graph theory)|degree of the vertices of ''G''. The ''spectral gap'' of ''G'' is defined to be ''d''&nbsp;−&nbsp;λ<sub>2</sub>, and it measures the spectral expansion of the graph ''G''.<ref>This definition of the spectral gap is from Section 2.3 in harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006</ref>

It is known that λ<sub>''n''</sub> = −''d'' if and only if ''G'' is bipartite. In many contexts, for example in the expander mixing lemma, a bound on λ<sub>2</sub> is not enough, but indeed it is necessary to bound the absolute value of ''all'' the eigenvalues away from ''d'':
:<math>\lambda=\max\{|\lambda_2|, |\lambda_n|\}.</math>
Since this is the largest eigenvalue corresponding to an eigenvector orthogonal to ''u'', it can be equivalently defined using the Rayleigh quotient:
:<math>\lambda=\max_{v \perp u , v \neq 0} \frac{\|Av\|_2}{\|v\|_2},</math>
where 
:<math>\|v\|_2=\left(\sum_{i=1}^n v_i^2\right)^{1/2}</math> 
is the 2-norm of the vector <math>v\in\R^n</math>.

The normalized versions of these definitions are also widely used and more convenient in stating some results. Here one considers the matrix <math>\tfrac{1}{d} A</math>, which is the Markov transition matrix of the graph ''G''. Its eigenvalues are between −1 and 1. For not necessarily regular graphs, the spectrum of a graph can be defined similarly using the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. For directed graphs, one considers the singular values of the adjacency matrix ''A'', which are equal to the roots of the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix ''A<sup>T</sup>A''.

Relationships between different expansion properties
The expansion parameters defined above are related to each other. In particular, for any ''d''-regular graph ''G'',

:<math>h_{\text{out(G) \le h(G) \le d \cdot h_{\text{out(G).</math>

Consequently, for constant degree graphs, vertex and edge expansion are qualitatively the same.

=Cheeger inequalities=
When ''G'' is ''d''-regular, there is a relationship between the isoperimetric constant ''h''(''G'') and the gap ''d'' − λ<sub>2</sub> in the spectrum of the adjacency operator of ''G''. By standard spectral graph theory, the trivial eigenvalue of the adjacency operator of a ''d''-regular graph is λ<sub>1</sub>=''d'' and the first non-trivial eigenvalue is λ<sub>2</sub>. If ''G'' is connected, then λ<sub>2</sub> < ''d''. An inequality due to DodziukSfn|Dodziuk|1984 and independently Noga Alon|Alon and Vitali Milman|MilmanSfn|Alon|Spencer|2011 states that<ref>Theorem 2.4 in harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006</ref>

: <math>\tfrac{1}{2}(d - \lambda_2) \le h(G) \le \sqrt{2d(d - \lambda_2)}.</math>

This inequality is closely related to the Cheeger bound for Markov chains and can be seen as a discrete version of Cheeger constant#Cheeger.27s inequality|Cheeger's inequality in Riemannian geometry.

Similar connections between vertex isoperimetric numbers and the spectral gap have also been studied:<ref>See Theorem 1 and p.156, l.1 in harvtxt|Bobkov|Houdré|Tetali|2000. Note that λ<sub>2</sub> there corresponds to 2(''d''&nbsp;−&nbsp;λ<sub>2</sub>) of the current article (see p.153, l.5)</ref>
: <math>h_{\text{out(G)\le \left(\sqrt{4 (d-\lambda_2)} + 1\right)^2 -1</math>
: <math>h_{\text{in(G) \le \sqrt{8(d-\lambda_2)}.</math>
Asymptotically speaking, the quantities <math>\frac{h^2}{d}</math>, <math>h_{\text{out</math>, and <math>h_{\text{in^2</math> are all bounded above by the spectral gap <math>O(d-\lambda_2)</math>.

Constructions
There are three general strategies for constructing families of expander graphs.<ref>see, e.g., harvtxt|Yehudayoff|2012</ref> The first strategy is algebraic and group-theoretic, the second strategy is analytic and uses additive combinatorics, and the third strategy is combinatorial and uses the zig-zag product|zig-zag and related graph products. Noga Alon showed that certain graphs constructed from finite geometry|finite geometries are the sparsest examples of highly expanding graphs.<ref>cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF02579382 | volume=6 |issue = 3| title=Eigenvalues, geometric expanders, sorting in rounds, and ramsey theory | journal=Combinatorica | pages=207–219 | year=1986 | last1 = Alon | first1 = Noga| citeseerx=10.1.1.300.5945 </ref>

=Margulis–Gabber–Galil=
Abstract algebra|Algebraic constructions based on Cayley graphs are known for various variants of expander graphs. The following construction is due to Margulis and has been analysed by Gabber and Galil.<ref>see, e.g., p.9 of harvtxt|Goldreich|2011</ref> For every natural number ''n'', one considers the graph ''G<sub>n</sub>'' with the vertex set <math>\mathbb Z_n \times \mathbb Z_n</math>, where <math>\mathbb Z_n=\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z</math>: For every vertex <math>(x,y)\in\mathbb Z_n \times \mathbb Z_n</math>, its eight adjacent vertices are

:<math>(x \pm 2y,y), (x \pm (2y+1),y), (x,y \pm 2x), (x,y \pm (2x+1)).</math>

Then the following holds:

<blockquote>Theorem. For all ''n'', the graph ''G<sub>n</sub>'' has second-largest eigenvalue <math>\lambda(G)\leq 5 \sqrt{2}</math>.</blockquote>

=Ramanujan graphs=
main article|Ramanujan graph
By a theorem of Alon and Boppana, all large enough ''d''-regular graphs satisfy <math>\lambda \ge 2\sqrt{d-1} - o(1)</math>, where λ is the second largest eigenvalue in absolute value.<ref>Theorem 2.7 of harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006</ref> Ramanujan graphs are ''d''-regular graphs for which this bound is tight. That is, they satisfy <math>\lambda \le 2\sqrt{d-1}</math>.<ref>Definition 5.11 of harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006</ref> Hence Ramanujan graphs have an asymptotically smallest possible λ. They are also excellent spectral expanders.

Alexander Lubotzky|Lubotzky, Phillips, and Peter Sarnak|Sarnak (1988), Margulis (1988), and Morgenstern (1994) show how Ramanujan graphs can be constructed explicitly.<ref>Theorem 5.12 of harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006</ref> By a theorem of Friedman (2003), Random regular graph|random ''d''-regular graphs on ''n'' vertices are almost Ramanujan, that is, they satisfy

:<math>\lambda \le 2\sqrt{d-1}+\varepsilon</math>

for every <math>\varepsilon > 0</math> with probability <math>1-o(1)</math> as ''n'' tends to infinity.<ref>Theorem 7.10 of harvtxt|Hoory|Linial|Widgerson|2006</ref>

Applications and useful properties
The original motivation for expanders is to build economical robust networks (phone or computer): an expander with bounded valence is precisely an asymptotic robust graph with the number of edges growing linearly with size (number of vertices), for all subsets.

Expander graphs have found extensive applications in computer science, in designing algorithms, Expander code|error correcting codes, Extractor (mathematics)|extractors, pseudorandom generators, sorting networks (harvtxt|Ajtai|Komlós|Szemerédi|1983) and robust computer networks. They have also been used in proofs of many important results in computational complexity theory, such as SL (complexity)|SL&nbsp;=&nbsp;L (complexity)|L (harvtxt|Reingold|2008) and the PCP theorem (harvtxt|Dinur|2007). In cryptography, expander graphs are used to construct hash functions.

The following are some properties of expander graphs that have proven useful in many areas.

=Expander mixing lemma=
Main article|Expander mixing lemma
The expander mixing lemma states that, for any two subsets of the vertices ''S'', ''T'' ⊆ ''V'', the number of edges between ''S'' and ''T'' is approximately what you would expect in a random ''d''-regular graph. The approximation is better the smaller <math>\lambda=\max\{|\lambda_2|,|\lambda_n|\}</math> is. In a random ''d''-regular graph, as well as in an Erdős–Rényi model|Erdős–Rényi random graph with edge probability ''d''/''n'', we expect <math>\tfrac{d}{n} \cdot |S| \cdot |T|</math> edges between ''S'' and ''T''.

More formally, let ''E''(''S'', ''T'') denote the number of edges between ''S'' and ''T''. If the two sets are not disjoint, edges in their intersection are counted twice, that is,

: <math>E(S,T)=2|E(G[S\cap T])| + E(S\setminus T,T) + E(S,T\setminus S). </math>

Then the expander mixing lemma says that the following inequality holds:

:<math>\left|E(S, T) - \frac{d \cdot |S| \cdot |T|}{n}\right| \leq d\lambda  \sqrt{|S| \cdot |T|},</math>

where ''λ'' is the absolute value of the normalized second largest eigenvalue.

=Expander walk sampling=
Main article|Expander walk sampling
The Chernoff bound states that, when sampling many independent samples from a random variables in the range [−1, 1], with high probability the average of our samples is close to the expectation of the random variable.  The expander walk sampling lemma, due to harvtxt|Ajtai|Komlós|Szemerédi|1987 and harvtxt|Gillman|1998, states that this also holds true when sampling from a walk on an expander graph. This is particularly useful in the theory of derandomization, since sampling according to an expander walk uses many fewer random bits than sampling independently.

=Expander property of the braingraphs=
Using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the NIH-funded large Human Connectome Project, it was shown by Szalkai et al.<ref name=":47">Cite journal|title = Graph Theoretical Analysis Reveals: Women's Brains Are Better Connected than Men's|last1 = Szalkai |first1 = Balazs | last2 = Varga | first2 = Balint | last3 = Grolmusz | first3 = Vince | date = 2015|journal = PLoS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0130045|volume=10|number=7|pages=e0130045|pmid=26132764 | pmc=4488527</ref><ref name="Szalkai2017">cite journal|last1=Szalkai|first1=Balázs|last2=Varga|first2=Bálint|last3=Grolmusz|first3=Vince|title=Brain size bias compensated graph-theoretical parameters are also better in women's structural connectomes|journal=Brain Imaging and Behavior|volume=12|issue=3|pages=663–673|year=2017|issn=1931-7565|doi=10.1007/s11682-017-9720-0|pmid=28447246</ref> that the graph, describing the anatomical brain connections between up to 1015 cerebral areas, is a significantly better expander in women than in men.
