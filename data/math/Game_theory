'''Game theory''' is the study of [[mathematical model]]s of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers.<ref name=Myerson>[[Roger B. Myerson|Myerson, Roger B.]] (1991). ''Game Theory: Analysis of Conflict,'' Harvard University Press, p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&printsec=find&pg=PA1 1]. Chapter-preview links, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&printsec=find&pg=PR7 vii–xi].</ref> It has applications in all fields of [[social science]], as well as in [[logic]] and [[computer science]]. Originally, it addressed [[zero-sum game]]s, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an [[umbrella term]] for the [[science]] of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.

Modern game theory began with the idea regarding the existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person [[zero-sum game]]s and its proof by [[John von Neumann]]. Von Neumann's original proof used the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] on continuous mappings into compact [[convex set]]s, which became a standard method in game theory and [[mathematical economics]]. His paper was followed by the 1944 book ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'', co-written with [[Oskar Morgenstern]], which considered [[cooperative game]]s of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.

Game theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars. It was later explicitly applied to biology in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. {{As of|2014}}, with the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] going to game theorist [[Jean Tirole]], eleven game theorists have won the economics Nobel Prize. [[John Maynard Smith]] was awarded the [[Crafoord Prize]] for his application of game theory to biology.

==History==
[[File:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|[[John von Neumann]]]]
[[File:John f nash 20061102 3.jpg|thumb|[[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]]]]

Early discussions of examples of two-person games occurred long before the rise of modern, mathematical game theory. The first known discussion of game theory occurred in a letter written by Charles Waldegrave, an active Jacobite, and uncle to [[James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave|James Waldegrave]], a British diplomat, in 1713.<ref name="GT-PD-01">{{citation |url=http://www.jehps.net/Decembre2007/Bellhouse.pdf |title=The Problem of Waldegrave |author=Bellhouse, David |journal=Journal Électronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique |year=2007 |volume=3 |issue=2}}</ref> In this letter, Waldegrave provides a [[minimax]] [[mixed strategy]] solution to a two-person version of the card game [[le Her]], and the problem is now known as [[Waldegrave problem]]. [[James Madison]] made what is now recognized as a game-theoretic analysis of the ways states can be expected to behave under different systems of taxation.<ref>James Madison, [http://www.constitution.org/jm/17870400_vices.htm Vices of the Political System of the United States], April 1787.</ref><ref>Jack Rakove, [http://www.historynow.org/09_2007/historian2.html "James Madison and the Constitution"], ''History Now'', Issue 13, September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411192100/http://www.historynow.org/09_2007/historian2.html |date=11 April 2009 }}</ref> In his 1838 ''Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses'' (''Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth''), [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] considered a [[duopoly]] and presents a solution that is a restricted version of the [[Nash equilibrium]].

In 1913, [[Ernst Zermelo]] published ''Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels'' (''On an Application of Set Theory to the Theory of the Game of Chess''). It proved that the optimal chess strategy is [[Strictly determined game|strictly determined]]. This paved the way for more general theorems.<ref name=ohet />{{rp|429}}

In 1938, the Danish mathematical economist [[Frederik Zeuthen]] proved that the mathematical model had a winning strategy by using [[Brouwer fixed point theorem|Brouwer's fixed point theorem]].<ref>{{cite book|editor=Kim, Sungwook|title=Game theory applications in network design|page=3|publisher=IGI Global|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phOXBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA3|isbn=9781466660519}}</ref> In his 1938 book ''Applications aux Jeux de Hasard'' and earlier notes, [[Émile Borel]] proved a minimax theorem for two-person zero-sum matrix games only when the pay-off matrix was symmetric. Borel conjectured that non-existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games would occur, a conjecture that was proved false.

Game theory did not really exist as a unique field until [[John von Neumann]] published the paper ''On the Theory of Games of Strategy'' <!--singluar, as only one referenced in Aumann (1987)--> in 1928.<ref>{{citation |first=J. v. |last=Neumann |year=1928 |title=Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=295–320 |doi=10.1007/BF01448847}} English translation: {{citation |chapter=On the Theory of Games of Strategy |editor1-first=A.

Von Neumann's work in game theory culminated in this 1944 book. This foundational work contains the method for finding mutually consistent solutions for two-person zero-sum games. During the following time period, work on game theory was primarily focused on [[cooperative game]] theory, which analyzes optimal strategies for groups of individuals, presuming that they can enforce agreements between them about proper strategies.<ref>{{citation |last=Leonard |first=Robert |title=Von Neumann, Morgenstern, and the Creation of Game Theory |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=9780521562669}}</ref>

In 1950, the first mathematical discussion of the [[prisoner's dilemma]] appeared, and an experiment was undertaken by notable mathematicians [[Merrill M. Flood]] and [[Melvin Dresher]], as part of the [[RAND Corporation]]'s investigations into game theory. RAND pursued the studies because of possible applications to global [[nuclear strategy]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/ Prisoner's Dilemma]. Plato.stanford.edu (4 September 1997). Retrieved on 3 January 2013.</ref> Around this same time, [[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]] developed a criterion for mutual consistency of players' strategies, known as [[Nash equilibrium]], applicable to a wider variety of games than the criterion proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern. Nash proved that every n-player, non-zero-sum (not just 2-player zero-sum) [[non-cooperative game]] has what is now known as a Nash equilibrium.

Game theory experienced a flurry of activity in the 1950s, during which time the concepts of the [[core (economics)|core]], the [[extensive form game]], [[fictitious play]], [[repeated game]]s, and the [[Shapley value]] were developed. In addition, the first applications of game theory to [[philosophy]] and [[political science]] occurred during this time.

In 1979 [[Robert Axelrod]] tried setting up computer programs as players and found that in tournaments between them the winner was often a simple "tit-for-tat" program that cooperates on the first step, then on subsequent steps just does whatever its opponent did on the previous step. The same winner was also often obtained by natural selection; a fact widely taken to explain cooperation phenomena in evolutionary biology and the social sciences.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1104|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0}}</ref>

===Prize-winning achievements===

In 1965, [[Reinhard Selten]] introduced his [[solution concept]] of [[Subgame perfect equilibrium|subgame perfect equilibria]], which further refined the Nash equilibrium (later he would introduce [[trembling hand perfection]] as well). In 1994 Nash, Selten and [[John Harsanyi|Harsanyi]] became [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Economics Nobel Laureates]] for their contributions to economic game theory.

In the 1970s, game theory was extensively applied in [[biology]], largely as a result of the work of [[John Maynard Smith]] and his [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. In addition, the concepts of [[correlated equilibrium]], trembling hand perfection, and [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]]<ref>Although common knowledge was first discussed by the philosopher [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] in his dissertation (and later book) ''Convention'' in the late 1960s, it was not widely considered by economists until [[Robert Aumann]]'s work in the 1970s.</ref> were introduced and analyzed.

In 2005, game theorists [[Thomas Schelling]] and [[Robert Aumann]] followed Nash, Selten and Harsanyi as Nobel Laureates. Schelling worked on dynamic models, early examples of [[evolutionary game theory]]. Aumann contributed more to the equilibrium school, introducing an equilibrium coarsening, correlated equilibrium, and developing an extensive formal analysis of the assumption of common knowledge and of its consequences.

In 2007, [[Leonid Hurwicz]], together with [[Eric Maskin]] and [[Roger Myerson]], was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics "for having laid the foundations of [[mechanism design]] theory". Myerson's contributions include the notion of [[proper equilibrium]], and an important graduate text: ''Game Theory, Analysis of Conflict''.<ref name=Myerson /> Hurwicz introduced and formalized the concept of [[incentive compatibility]].

In 2012, [[Alvin E. Roth]] and [[Lloyd Shapley|Lloyd S. Shapley]] were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics "for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design" and, in 2014, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel]] went to game theorist [[Jean Tirole]].

==Game types==

===Cooperative / Non-cooperative===
{{main|Cooperative game|Non-cooperative game}}
A game is ''cooperative'' if the players are able to form binding commitments externally enforced (e.g. through [[contract law]]). A game is ''non-cooperative'' if players cannot form alliances or if all agreements need to be [[Self-enforcing agreement|self-enforcing]] (e.g. through [[credible threat]]s).<sup>[[Cooperative game theory#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup>

Cooperative games are often analysed through the framework of ''cooperative game theory''''',''' which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form, the joint actions that groups take and the resulting collective payoffs. It is opposed to the traditional ''non-cooperative game theory'' which focuses on predicting individual players' actions and payoffs and analyzing [[Nash equilibria]].<sup>[[Cooperative game theory#cite note-2|[2]]][[Cooperative game theory#cite note-3|[3]]]</sup>

Cooperative game theory provides a high-level approach as it only describes the structure, strategies and payoffs of coalitions, whereas non-cooperative game theory also looks at how bargaining procedures will affect the distribution of payoffs within each coalition. As non-cooperative game theory is more general, cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non-cooperative game theory (the converse does not hold) provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation. While it would thus be optimal to have all games expressed under a non-cooperative framework, in many instances insufficient information is available to accurately model the formal procedures available to the players during the strategic bargaining process, or the resulting model would be of too high complexity to offer a practical tool in the real world. In such cases, cooperative game theory provides a simplified approach that allows analysis of the game at large without having to make any assumption about bargaining powers.

===Symmetric / Asymmetric===
{{Payoff matrix |Name=An asymmetric game |2L=E |2R=F |1U=E |UL=1, 2 |UR=0, 0 |1D=F |DL=0, 0 |DR=1, 2}}
{{main|Symmetric game}}
A symmetric game is a game where the payoffs for playing a particular strategy depend only on the other strategies employed, not on who is playing them. If the identities of the players can be changed without changing the payoff to the strategies, then a game is symmetric. Many of the commonly studied 2×2 games are symmetric. The standard representations of [[Game of chicken|chicken]], the [[prisoner's dilemma]], and the [[stag hunt]] are all symmetric games. Some{{Who|date=July 2012}} scholars would consider certain asymmetric games as examples of these games as well. However, the most common payoffs for each of these games are symmetric.

Most commonly studied asymmetric games are games where there are not identical strategy sets for both players. For instance, the [[ultimatum game]] and similarly the [[dictator game]] have different strategies for each player. It is possible, however, for a game to have identical strategies for both players, yet be asymmetric. For example, the game pictured to the right is asymmetric despite having identical strategy sets for both players.

===Zero-sum / Non-zero-sum===
{{Payoff matrix |Name=A zero-sum game |2L=A |2R=B |1U=A |UL=–1, 1 |UR=3, –3 |1D=B |DL=0, 0 |DR=–2, 2}}
{{main|Zero-sum game}}
Zero-sum games are a special case of constant-sum games, in which choices by players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources. In zero-sum games the total benefit to all players in the game, for every combination of strategies, always adds to zero (more informally, a player benefits only at the equal expense of others).<ref>{{Cite book |title=Game Theory: Third Edition |last=Owen |first=Guillermo |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-12-531151-9 |location=Bingley |page=11}}</ref> [[Poker]] exemplifies a zero-sum game (ignoring the possibility of the house's cut), because one wins exactly the amount one's opponents lose. Other zero-sum games include [[matching pennies]] and most classical board games including [[Go (board game)|Go]] and [[chess]].

Many games studied by game theorists (including the famed [[prisoner's dilemma]]) are non-zero-sum games, because the [[Outcome (game theory)|outcome]] has net results greater or less than zero. Informally, in non-zero-sum games, a gain by one player does not necessarily correspond with a loss by another.

Constant-sum games correspond to activities like theft and gambling, but not to the fundamental economic situation in which there are potential [[gains from trade]]. It is possible to transform any game into a (possibly asymmetric) zero-sum game by adding a dummy player (often called "the board") whose losses compensate the players' net winnings.

===Simultaneous / Sequential===
{{main|Simultaneous game|Sequential game}}
[[Simultaneous game]]s are games where both players move simultaneously, or if they do not move simultaneously, the later players are unaware of the earlier players' actions (making them ''effectively'' simultaneous). [[Sequential game]]s (or dynamic games) are games where later players have some knowledge about earlier actions. This need not be [[perfect information]] about every action of earlier players; it might be very little knowledge. For instance, a player may know that an earlier player did not perform one particular action, while s/he does not know which of the other available actions the first player actually performed.

The difference between simultaneous and sequential games is captured in the different representations discussed above. Often, [[Normal form game|normal form]] is used to represent simultaneous games, while [[Extensive form game|extensive form]] is used to represent sequential ones. The transformation of extensive to normal form is one way, meaning that multiple extensive form games correspond to the same normal form. Consequently, notions of equilibrium for simultaneous games are insufficient for reasoning about sequential games; see [[subgame perfection]].

In short, the differences between sequential and simultaneous games are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! Sequential !! Simultaneous </tr>
| Normally denoted by || [[Decision tree]]s || [[Payoff matrix|Payoff matrices]] </tr>
| {{longitem|style=line-height:1.3em;padding-right:0.65em|Prior knowledge<br />of opponent's move?}} || Yes || No </tr>
| Time axis?    || Yes || No </tr>

|}

===Perfect information and imperfect information===
{{main|Perfect information}}
[[File:PD with outside option.svg|thumb|250px|right|A game of imperfect information (the dotted line represents ignorance on the part of player 2, formally called an [[Information set (game theory)|information set]])]]

An important subset of sequential games consists of games of [[perfect information]]. A game is one of perfect information if all players know the moves previously made by all other players. Most games studied in game theory are imperfect-information games.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Examples of perfect-information games include [[tic-tac-toe]], [[Draughts|checkers]], [[infinite chess]], and [[Go (board game)|Go]].<ref>[https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/Game_Theory/mat.pdf https://www.math.ucla.edu] Game Theory (Ferguson).</ref><ref>[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/845380/complete-vs-perfect-infomation-in-combinatorial-game-theory https://math.stackexchange.com] Complete vs Perfect information in Combinatorial game theory.</ref><ref>[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6b10/22cb68df1918513948830734be796e052fe2.pdf https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org] Games with Perfect Information (Mycielski).</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN-I6u-AxMg "Infinite Chess, PBS Infinite Series"] PBS Infinite Series. Perfect information defined at 0:25, with academic sources https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4377 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08155.</ref>

Many card games are games of imperfect information, such as [[poker]] and [[contract bridge|bridge]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Game Theory: Third Edition |last=Owen |first=Guillermo |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-12-531151-9 |location=Bingley |page=4}}</ref> Perfect information is often confused with [[complete information]], which is a similar concept.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Complete information requires that every player know the strategies and payoffs available to the other players but not necessarily the actions taken. Games of incomplete information can be reduced, however, to games of imperfect information by introducing "[[Move by nature|moves by nature]]".{{sfnp|Leyton-Brown|Shoham|2008|p=60}}

==={{vanchor|Combinatorial games}}===
<!-- visible anchor to link to, for example at "Solving chess" -->

Games in which the difficulty of finding an optimal strategy stems from the multiplicity of possible moves are called combinatorial games. Examples include chess and go. Games that involve [[Perfect information|imperfect information]] may also have a strong combinatorial character, for instance [[backgammon]]. There is no unified theory addressing combinatorial elements in games. There are, however, mathematical tools that can solve particular problems and answer general questions.<ref name="Bewersdorff2005" />

Games of [[perfect information]] have been studied in [[combinatorial game theory]], which has developed novel representations, e.g. [[surreal numbers]], as well as [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] and [[Abstract algebra|algebraic]] (and [[Strategy stealing argument|sometimes non-constructive]]) proof methods to [[Solved game|solve games]] of certain types, including "loopy" games that may result in infinitely long sequences of moves. These methods address games with higher combinatorial complexity than those usually considered in traditional (or "economic") game theory.<ref>{{citation |last1=Albert |first1=Michael H. |author1-link=Michael H. Albert |last2=Nowakowski |first2=Richard J. |last3=Wolfe |first3=David |isbn=978-1-56881-277-9 |publisher=A K Peters Ltd |title=Lessons in Play: In Introduction to Combinatorial Game Theory |year=2007 |pages=3–4}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Beck |first=József |author-link=József Beck |isbn=978-0-521-46100-9 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |title=Combinatorial games: tic-tac-toe theory |year=2008 |pages=1–3}}</ref> A typical game that has been solved this way is [[Hex (board game)|hex]]. A related field of study, drawing from [[computational complexity theory]], is [[game complexity]], which is concerned with estimating the computational difficulty of finding optimal strategies.<ref>{{citation |author1=Robert A. Hearn |author2=Erik D. Demaine |title=Games, Puzzles, and Computation |year=2009 |publisher=A K Peters, Ltd. |isbn=978-1-56881-322-6}}</ref>

Research in [[artificial intelligence]] has addressed both perfect and imperfect information games that have very complex combinatorial structures (like chess, go, or backgammon) for which no provable optimal strategies have been found. The practical solutions involve computational heuristics, like [[alpha-beta pruning]] or use of [[artificial neural network]]s trained by [[reinforcement learning]], which make games more tractable in computing practice.<ref name="Bewersdorff2005">{{citation |author=[[Jörg Bewersdorff]] |title=Luck, logic, and white lies: the mathematics of games |year=2005 |publisher=A K Peters, Ltd. |isbn=978-1-56881-210-6 |pages=ix–xii and chapter 31}}</ref><ref name="Jones2008">{{citation |author=M. Tim Jones |title=Artificial Intelligence: A Systems Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |isbn=978-0-7637-7337-3 |pages=106–118}}</ref>

===Infinitely long games===
{{main|Determinacy}}
Games, as studied by economists and real-world game players, are generally finished in finitely <!--Do not change to 'infinitely'-->many moves. Pure mathematicians are not so constrained, and [[Set theory|set theorists]] in particular study games that last for infinitely many moves, with the winner (or other payoff) not known until ''after'' all those moves are completed.

The focus of attention is usually not so much on the best way to play such a game, but whether one player has a [[Determinacy#Basic notions|winning strategy]]. (It can be proven, using the [[axiom of choice]], that there are games{{spaced ndash}}even with perfect information and where the only outcomes are "win" or "lose"{{spaced ndash}}for which ''neither'' player has a winning strategy.) The existence of such strategies, for cleverly designed games, has important consequences in [[descriptive set theory]].

===Discrete and continuous games===
Much of game theory is concerned with finite, discrete games, that have a finite number of players, moves, events, outcomes, etc. Many concepts can be extended, however. [[Continuous game]]s allow players to choose a strategy from a continuous strategy set. For instance, [[Cournot competition]] is typically modeled with players' strategies being any non-negative quantities, including fractional quantities.

===Differential games===
[[Differential game]]s such as the continuous [[Pursuit-evasion|pursuit and evasion game]] are continuous games where the evolution of the players' state variables is governed by [[differential equation]]s. The problem of finding an optimal strategy in a differential game is closely related to the [[optimal control]] theory. In particular, there are two types of strategies: the open-loop strategies are found using the [[Pontryagin's Minimum Principle|Pontryagin maximum principle]] while the closed-loop strategies are found using [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation|Bellman's Dynamic Programming]] method.

A particular case of differential games are the games with a random [[time horizon]].<ref name="PM66">{{ru icon}} Petrosjan, L.A. and Murzov, N.V. (1966). ''Game-theoretic problems of mechanics''. ''Litovsk. Mat. Sb.'' 6, 423–433.</ref> In such games, the terminal time is a random variable with a given [[probability distribution]] function. Therefore, the players maximize the [[mathematical expectation]] of the cost function. It was shown that the modified optimization problem can be reformulated as a discounted differential game over an infinite time interval.

===Evolutionary game theory===
[[Evolutionary game theory]] studies players who adjust their strategies over time according to rules that are not necessarily rational or farsighted.<ref name=Newton2018renaissance>{{cite journal | last1=Newton | first1=Jonathan | year=2018 | title=Evolutionary Game Theory: A Renaissance | journal=Games | volume=9 | issue=2| pages=31 | doi=10.3390/g9020031}}</ref>  In general, the evolution of strategies over time according to such rules is modeled as a [[Markov chain]] with a state variable such as the current strategy profile or how the game has been played in the recent past. Such rules may feature imitation, optimization or survival of the fittest.

In biology, such models can represent (biological) [[evolution]], in which offspring adopt their parents' strategies and parents who play more successful strategies (i.e. corresponding to higher payoffs) have a greater number of offspring. In the social sciences, such models typically represent strategic adjustment by players who play a game many times within their lifetime and, consciously or unconsciously, occasionally adjust their strategies.{{sfnp|Webb|2007}}

===Stochastic outcomes (and relation to other fields)===
Individual decision problems with stochastic outcomes are sometimes considered "one-player games". These situations are not considered game theoretical by some authors.{{By whom|date=March 2011}} They may be modeled using similar tools within the related disciplines of [[decision theory]], [[operations research]], and areas of [[artificial intelligence]], particularly [[AI planning]] (with uncertainty) and [[multi-agent system]]. Although these fields may have different motivators, the mathematics involved are substantially the same, e.g. using [[Markov decision process]]es (MDP).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Stochastic outcomes can also be modeled in terms of game theory by adding a randomly acting player who makes "chance moves" ("[[Move by nature|moves by nature]]").{{sfnp|Osborne|Rubinstein|1994}} This player is not typically considered a third player in what is otherwise a two-player game, but merely serves to provide a roll of the dice where required by the game.

For some problems, different approaches to modeling stochastic outcomes may lead to different solutions. For example, the difference in approach between MDPs and the [[Minimax|minimax solution]] is that the latter considers the worst-case over a set of adversarial moves, rather than reasoning in expectation about these moves given a fixed probability distribution. The minimax approach may be advantageous where stochastic models of uncertainty are not available, but may also be overestimating extremely unlikely (but costly) events, dramatically swaying the strategy in such scenarios if it is assumed that an adversary can force such an event to happen.<ref name="McMahan">Hugh Brendan McMahan (2006), ''[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mcmahan/research/mcmahan_thesis.pdf Robust Planning in Domains with Stochastic Outcomes, Adversaries, and Partial Observability]'', CMU-CS-06-166, pp. 3–4</ref> (See [[Black swan theory]] for more discussion on this kind of modeling issue, particularly as it relates to predicting and limiting losses in investment banking.)

General models that include all elements of stochastic outcomes, adversaries, and partial or noisy observability (of moves by other players) have also been studied. The "[[gold standard]]" is considered to be partially observable [[stochastic game]] (POSG), but few realistic problems are computationally feasible in POSG representation.<ref name="McMahan" />

===Metagames===
These are games the play of which is the development of the rules for another game, the target or subject game. [[Metagame]]s seek to maximize the utility value of the rule set developed. The theory of metagames is related to [[mechanism design]] theory.

The term [[metagame analysis]] is also used to refer to a practical approach developed by Nigel Howard.{{sfnp|Howard|1971}} whereby a situation is framed as a strategic game in which stakeholders try to realise their objectives by means of the options available to them. Subsequent developments have led to the formulation of [[confrontation analysis]].

===Pooling games===
These are games prevailing over all forms of society. Pooling games are repeated plays with changing payoff table in general over an experienced path and their equilibrium strategies usually take a form of evolutionary social convention and economic convention. Pooling game theory emerges to formally recognize the interaction between optimal choice in one play and the emergence of forthcoming payoff table update path, identify the invariance existence and robustness, and predict variance over time. The theory is based upon topological transformation classification of payoff table update over time to predict variance and invariance, and is also within the jurisdiction of the computational law of reachable optimality for ordered system.<ref>Wenliang Wang (2015). Pooling Game Theory and Public Pension Plan. {{isbn|978-1507658246}}.</ref>

===Mean field game theory===
[[Mean field game theory]] is the study of strategic decision making in very large populations of small interacting agents. This class of problems was considered in the economics literature by [[Boyan Jovanovic]] and [[Robert W. Rosenthal]], in the engineering literature by [[Peter E. Caines]] and by mathematician [[Pierre-Louis Lions]] and Jean-Michel Lasry.

==Representation of games==
{{see also|List of games in game theory}}

The games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects. To be fully defined, a game must specify the following elements: the [[Player (game)|''players'' of the game]], the ''information'' and ''actions'' available to each player at each decision point, and the [[Utility|''payoffs'']] for each outcome. (Eric Rasmusen refers to these four "essential elements" by the acronym "PAPI".)<ref name="r7" /> A game theorist typically uses these elements, along with a [[solution concept]] of their choosing, to deduce a set of equilibrium [[Strategy (game theory)|strategies]] for each player such that, when these strategies are employed, no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. These equilibrium strategies determine an [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] to the game—a stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability.

Most cooperative games are presented in the characteristic function form, while the extensive and the normal forms are used to define noncooperative games.

===Extensive form===

[[File:Ultimatum Game Extensive Form.svg|thumb|left|An extensive form game]]
The extensive form can be used to formalize games with a time sequencing of moves. Games here are played on [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] (as pictured here). Here each [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|vertex]] (or node) represents a point of choice for a player. The player is specified by a number listed by the vertex. The lines out of the vertex represent a possible action for that player. The payoffs are specified at the bottom of the tree. The extensive form can be viewed as a multi-player generalization of a [[decision tree]].{{sfnp|Fudenberg|Tirole|1991|p=67}} To solve any extensive form game, [[backward induction]] must be used. It involves working backward up the game tree to determine what a rational player would do at the last vertex of the tree, what the player with the previous move would do given that the player with the last move is rational, and so on until the first vertex of the tree is reached.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Security Studies: an Introduction (second edition) |last=Williams |first=Paul D. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn= |location=2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon, OX14 4RN |pages=55–56 |quote= |via=}}</ref>

The game pictured consists of two players.  The way this particular game is structured (i.e., with sequential decision making and perfect information), ''Player 1'' "moves" first by choosing either ''F'' or ''U'' (Fair or Unfair). Next in the sequence, ''Player 2'', who has now seen ''Player 1''{{'}}s move, chooses to play either ''A'' or ''R''. Once ''Player 2'' has made his/ her choice, the game is considered finished and each player gets their respective payoff.  Suppose that ''Player 1'' chooses ''U'' and then ''Player 2'' chooses ''A'': ''Player 1'' then gets a payoff of "eight" (which in real-world terms can be interpreted in many ways, the simplest of which is in terms of money but could mean things such as eight days of vacation or eight countries conquered or even eight more opportunities to play the same game against other players) and ''Player 2'' gets a payoff of "two".

The extensive form can also capture simultaneous-move games and games with imperfect information. To represent it, either a dotted line connects different vertices to represent them as being part of the same information set (i.e. the players do not know at which point they are), or a closed line is drawn around them. (See example in the [[#Perfect information and imperfect information|imperfect information section]].)

{{main|Normal-form game}}
The normal (or strategic form) game is usually represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] which shows the players, strategies, and payoffs (see the example to the right). More generally it can be represented by any function that associates a payoff for each player with every possible combination of actions. In the accompanying example there are two players; one chooses the row and the other chooses the column. Each player has two strategies, which are specified by the number of rows and the number of columns. The payoffs are provided in the interior. The first number is the payoff received by the row player (Player 1 in our example); the second is the payoff for the column player (Player 2 in our example). Suppose that Player 1 plays ''Up'' and that Player 2 plays ''Left''. Then Player 1 gets a payoff of 4, and Player 2 gets 3.

When a game is presented in normal form, it is presumed that each player acts simultaneously or, at least, without knowing the actions of the other. If players have some information about the choices of other players, the game is usually presented in extensive form.

Every extensive-form game has an equivalent normal-form game, however the transformation to normal form may result in an exponential blowup in the size of the representation, making it computationally impractical.{{sfnp|Leyton-Brown|Shoham|2008|p=35}}

===Characteristic function form===
{{main|Cooperative game}}
In games that possess removable utility, separate rewards are not given; rather, the characteristic function decides the payoff of each unity. The idea is that the unity that is 'empty', so to speak, does not receive a reward at all.

The origin of this form is to be found in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's book; when looking at these instances, they guessed that when a union <math>\mathbf{C}</math> appears, it works against the fraction
<math>
\left(\frac{\mathbf{N}}{\mathbf{C}}\right)
</math>
as if two individuals were playing a normal game. The balanced payoff of C is a basic function. Although there are differing examples that help determine coalitional amounts from normal games, not all appear that in their function form can be derived from such.

Formally, a characteristic function is seen as: (N,v), where N represents the group of people and <math>v:2^N \to \mathbf{R}</math> is a normal utility.

Such characteristic functions have expanded to describe games where there is no removable utility.

==General and applied uses==

As a method of [[applied mathematics]], game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and animal behaviors. It was initially developed in [[economics]] to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including behaviors of firms, markets, and consumers. The first use of game-theoretic analysis was by [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in 1838 with his solution of the [[Cournot competition|Cournot duopoly]]. The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well.

Although pre-twentieth century [[Natural history|naturalists]] such as [[Charles Darwin]] made game-theoretic kinds of statements, the use of game-theoretic analysis in biology began with [[Ronald Fisher]]'s studies of animal behavior during the 1930s. This work predates the name "game theory", but it shares many important features with this field. The developments in economics were later applied to biology largely by [[John Maynard Smith]] in his book ''[[Evolution and the Theory of Games]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=On economic applications of evolutionary game theory|url=https://leeps.ucsc.edu/media/papers/EconAppEvolGameTheory3-1-98.pdf|journal=J Evol Econ|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>

In addition to being used to describe, predict, and explain behavior, game theory has also been used to develop theories of ethical or normative behavior and to [[Decision theory#Normative and descriptive decision theory|prescribe]] such behavior.<ref name="Camerer2003">[[Colin F. Camerer]] (2003). ''Behavioral Game Theory: Experiments in Strategic Interaction'', pp. 5–7 (scroll to at [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7517.html 1.1 What Is Game Theory Good For?]).</ref> In [[economics and philosophy]], scholars have applied game theory to help in the understanding of good or proper behavior. Game-theoretic arguments of this type can be found as far back as [[Plato]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2008/entries/game-theory/ |title=Game Theory |accessdate=21 August 2008 |last=Ross |first=Don |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2008 Edition) |publisher=Edward N. Zalta (ed.)}}</ref> An alternative version of game theory, called [[chemical game theory]], represents the player's choices as metaphorical chemical reactant molecules called “knowlecules”.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Velegol|first=Darrell|last2=Suhey|first2=Paul|last3=Connolly|first3=John|last4=Morrissey|first4=Natalie|last5=Cook|first5=Laura|date=2018-09-14|title=Chemical Game Theory|journal=Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research|language=en|volume=57|issue=41|pages=13593–13607|doi=10.1021/acs.iecr.8b03835|issn=0888-5885}}</ref>  Chemical game theory then calculates the outcomes as equilibrium solutions to a system of chemical reactions.

===Description and modeling===
[[File:Centipede game.svg|thumb|300px|right|A four-stage [[centipede game]]]]
The primary use of game theory is to describe and [[Conceptual model#Economic models|model]] how human populations behave. Some{{Who|date=July 2012}} scholars believe that by finding the equilibria of games they can predict how actual human populations will behave when confronted with situations analogous to the game being studied. This particular view of game theory has been criticized. It is argued that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated when applied to real-world situations. Game theorists usually assume players act rationally, but in practice, human behavior often deviates from this model. Game theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used in [[physics]]. Thus while their assumptions do not always hold, they can treat game theory as a reasonable scientific [[Idealization (science philosophy)|ideal]] akin to the models used by [[physicist]]s. However, empirical work has shown that in some classic games, such as the [[centipede game]], [[guess 2/3 of the average]] game, and the [[dictator game]], people regularly do not play Nash equilibria. There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments and whether the analysis of the experiments fully captures all aspects of the relevant situation.<ref>Experimental work in game theory goes by many names, [[experimental economics]], [[behavioral economics]], and [[behavioural game theory]] are several. For a recent discussion, see Colin F. Camerer (2003). ''Behavioral Game Theory: Experiments in Strategic Interaction'' ([http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7517.html description] and [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7517.html Introduction], pp.&nbsp;1–25).</ref>

Some game theorists, following the work of [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price]], have turned to [[evolutionary game theory]] in order to resolve these issues. These models presume either no rationality or [[bounded rationality]] on the part of players. Despite the name, evolutionary game theory does not necessarily presume [[natural selection]] in the biological sense. Evolutionary game theory includes both biological as well as cultural evolution and also models of individual learning (for example, [[fictitious play]] dynamics).

===Prescriptive or normative analysis===
{{Payoff matrix |Name=The [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] | 2L=Cooperate |2R=Defect |1U=Cooperate |UL=-1, -1 |UR=-10, 0 |1D=Defect |DL=0, -10 |DR=-5, -5}}
Some scholars see game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of human beings, but as a suggestion for how people ought to behave. Since a strategy, corresponding to a [[Nash equilibrium]] of a game constitutes one's [[best response]] to the actions of the other players – provided they are in (the same) Nash equilibrium – playing a strategy that is part of a Nash equilibrium seems appropriate. This normative use of game theory has also come under criticism.

Game theory is a major method used in [[mathematical economics]] and business for [[Economic model|modeling]] competing behaviors of interacting [[Agent (economics)|agents]].<ref name=r1 /> Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as [[auction]]s, [[bargaining]], [[mergers & acquisitions]] pricing,<ref name="GT-A-E-00" /> [[fair division]], [[Duopoly|duopolies]], [[Oligopoly|oligopolies]], [[social network]] formation, [[agent-based computational economics]],<ref name=r2 /> [[general equilibrium]], [[mechanism design]],<ref name=r3 /> and [[voting system]]s;<ref name=r4 /> and across such broad areas as [[experimental economics]],<ref name=r5 /> [[Behavioral game theory|behavioral economics]],<ref name=r6 /> [[information economics]],<ref name=r7 /> [[industrial organization]],<ref name=r8 /> and [[political economy]].<ref name=r9 /><ref name=r10 />

This research usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as [[Solution concept|"solution concepts" or "equilibria"]]. A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the [[Nash equilibrium]]. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies. If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing.<ref name="GT-F-R-09">[http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 Game-theoretic model to examine the two tradeoffs in the acquisition of information for a careful balancing act] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524231021/http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 |date=24 May 2013 }} Research paper [[INSEAD]]</ref><ref name="GT-F-R-10">[https://web.archive.org/web/20140327103727/http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 Options Games: Balancing the trade-off between flexibility and commitment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620053305/http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 |date=20 June 2013 }}.

The payoffs of the game are generally taken to represent the [[utility]] of individual players.

A prototypical paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game that is an abstraction of a particular economic situation. One or more solution concepts are chosen, and the author demonstrates which strategy sets in the presented game are equilibria of the appropriate type. Naturally one might wonder to what use this information should be put. Economists and business professors suggest two primary uses (noted above): ''descriptive'' and ''[[Decision theory#Normative and descriptive decision theory|prescriptive]]''.<ref name="Camerer2003" />

===Political science===
The application of game theory to [[political science]] is focused in the overlapping areas of [[fair division]], [[political economy]], [[public choice]], [[war's inefficiency puzzle|war bargaining]], [[positive political theory]], and [[social choice theory]]. In each of these areas, researchers have developed game-theoretic models in which the players are often voters, states, special interest groups, and politicians.

Early examples of game theory applied to political science are provided by [[Anthony Downs]]. In his book ''[[An Economic Theory of Democracy]]'',<ref>{{harvard citations|last1=Downs|year=1957}}</ref> he applies the [[Hotelling's law|Hotelling firm location model]] to the political process. In the Downsian model, political candidates commit to ideologies on a one-dimensional policy space. Downs first shows how the political candidates will converge to the ideology preferred by the median voter if voters are fully informed, but then argues that voters choose to remain rationally ignorant which allows for candidate divergence. Game Theory was applied in 1962 to the [[Cuban missile crisis]] during the presidency of John F. Kennedy.<ref>Steven J. Brams, [https://plus.maths.org/content/game-theory-and-cuban-missile-crisis Game theory and the Cuban missile crisis], Plus Magazine, 1 January 2001, accessed 31 January 2016.</ref>

It has also been proposed that game theory explains the stability of any form of political government.  Taking the simplest case of a monarchy, for example, the king, being only one person, does not and cannot maintain his authority by personally exercising physical control over all or even any significant number of his subjects.  Sovereign control is instead explained by the recognition by each citizen that all other citizens expect each other to view the king (or other established government) as the person whose orders will be followed.  Coordinating communication among citizens to replace the sovereign is effectively barred, since conspiracy to replace the sovereign is generally punishable as a crime.  Thus, in a process that can be modeled by variants of the [[prisoner's dilemma]], during periods of stability no citizen will find it rational to move to replace the sovereign, even if all the citizens know they would be better off if they were all to act collectively.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2371076 |title=Yes, Law is the Command of the Sovereign |year=2013 |last1=Morrison |first1=A. S.}}</ref>

A game-theoretic explanation for [[Democratic peace theory|democratic peace]] is that public and open debate in democracies sends clear and reliable information regarding their intentions to other states. In contrast, it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders, what effect concessions will have, and if promises will be kept. Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a non-democracy.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1162/154247604323015463 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/539/ |jstor=40004867 |title=It Takes Two: An Explanation for the Democratic Peace |journal=Journal of the European Economic Association |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1–29 |year=2004 |last1=Levy |first1=G. |last2=Razin |first2=R.}}</ref>

On the other hand, game theory predicts that two countries may still go to war even if their leaders are cognizant of the costs of fighting. War may result from asymmetric information; two countries may have incentives to mis-represent the amount of military resources they have on hand, rendering them unable to settle disputes agreeably without resorting to fighting. Moreover, war may arise because of commitment problems: if two countries wish to settle a dispute via peaceful means, but each wishes to go back on the terms of that settlement, they may have no choice but to resort to warfare. Finally, war may result from issue indivisibilities.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fearon |first=James D. |date=1 January 1995 |title=Rationalist Explanations for War |journal=International Organization |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=379–414 |doi=10.1017/s0020818300033324 |jstor=2706903}}</ref>

Game theory could also help predict a nation's responses when there is a new rule or law to be applied to that nation. One example would be Peter John Wood's (2013) research when he looked into what nations could do to help reduce climate change. Wood thought this could be accomplished by making treaties with other nations to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. However, he concluded that this idea could not work because it would create a [[prisoner's dilemma]] to the nations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=Peter John |year=2011 |title=Climate change and game theory |url= |journal=[[Ecological Economics Review]] |volume=1219 |issue= 1|pages=153–70 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05891.x|pmid=21332497 |hdl=1885/67270|bibcode=2011NYASA1219..153W}}</ref>

{{main|Evolutionary game theory}}

Unlike those in economics, the payoffs for games in [[biology]] are often interpreted as corresponding to [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. In addition, the focus has been less on [[solution concept|equilibria]] that correspond to a notion of rationality and more on ones that would be maintained by [[evolution]]ary forces. The best-known equilibrium in biology is known as the ''[[evolutionarily stable strategy]]'' (ESS), first introduced in {{harv|Smith|Price|1973}}. Although its initial motivation did not involve any of the mental requirements of the [[Nash equilibrium]], every ESS is a Nash equilibrium.

In biology, game theory has been used as a model to understand many different phenomena. It was first used to explain the evolution (and stability) of the approximate 1:1 [[sex ratio]]s. {{harv|Fisher|1930}} suggested that the 1:1 sex ratios are a result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who could be seen as trying to maximize their number of grandchildren.

Additionally, biologists have used [[evolutionary game theory]] and the ESS to explain the emergence of [[animal communication]].{{sfnp|Harper|Maynard Smith|2003}} The analysis of [[signaling games]] and [[Cheap talk|other communication games]] has provided insight into the evolution of communication among animals. For example, the [[mobbing behavior]] of many species, in which a large number of prey animals attack a larger predator, seems to be an example of spontaneous emergent organization. Ants have also been shown to exhibit feed-forward behavior akin to fashion (see [[Paul Ormerod]]'s ''[[Butterfly Economics]]'').

Biologists have used the [[Chicken (game)|game of chicken]] to analyze fighting behavior and territoriality.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Maynard Smith |first1=J. |title=The theory of games and the evolution of animal conflicts |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(74)90110-6 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=209–221 |year=1974 |pmid=4459582 |pmc=}}</ref>

According to Maynard Smith, in the preface to ''Evolution and the Theory of Games'', "paradoxically, it has turned out that game theory is more readily applied to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which it was originally designed". Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many seemingly incongruous phenomena in nature.<ref name="stan-egt">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-evolutionary/ Evolutionary Game Theory (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]. Plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved on 3 January 2013.</ref>

One such phenomenon is known as [[Altruism in animals|biological altruism]]. This is a situation in which an organism appears to act in a way that benefits other organisms and is detrimental to itself. This is distinct from traditional notions of altruism because such actions are not conscious, but appear to be evolutionary adaptations to increase overall fitness. Examples can be found in species ranging from vampire bats that regurgitate blood they have obtained from a night's hunting and give it to group members who have failed to feed, to worker bees that care for the queen bee for their entire lives and never mate, to [[vervet monkey]]s that warn group members of a predator's approach, even when it endangers that individual's chance of survival.<ref name="qudzyh">[http://www.seop.leeds.ac.uk/entries/altruism-biological/ Biological Altruism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]. Seop.leeds.ac.uk. Retrieved on 3 January 2013.</ref> All of these actions increase the overall fitness of a group, but occur at a cost to the individual.

Evolutionary game theory explains this altruism with the idea of [[kin selection]]. Altruists discriminate between the individuals they help and favor relatives. [[Hamilton's rule]] explains the evolutionary rationale behind this selection with the equation {{Math|c < b &times; r}}, where the cost {{varserif|c}} to the altruist must be less than the benefit {{varserif|b}} to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness {{varserif|r}}. The more closely related two organisms are causes the incidences of altruism to increase because they share many of the same alleles. This means that the altruistic individual, by ensuring that the alleles of its close relative are passed on through survival of its offspring, can forgo the option of having offspring itself because the same number of alleles are passed on. For example, helping a sibling (in diploid animals) has a coefficient of ½, because (on average) an individual shares ½ of the alleles in its sibling's offspring. Ensuring that enough of a sibling's offspring survive to adulthood precludes the necessity of the altruistic individual producing offspring.<ref name="qudzyh" /> The coefficient values depend heavily on the scope of the playing field; for example if the choice of whom to favor includes all genetic living things, not just all relatives, we assume the discrepancy between all humans only accounts for approximately 1% of the diversity in the playing field, a coefficient that was ½ in the smaller field becomes 0.995. Similarly if it is considered that information other than that of a genetic nature (e.g. epigenetics, religion, science, etc.) persisted through time the playing field becomes larger still, and the discrepancies smaller.

===Computer science and logic===
Game theory has come to play an increasingly important role in [[logic]] and in [[computer science]]. Several logical theories have a basis in [[game semantics]]. In addition, computer scientists have used games to model [[interactive computation]]s. Also, game theory provides a theoretical basis to the field of [[multi-agent system]]s.

Separately, game theory has played a role in [[online algorithm]]s; in particular, the [[k-server problem]], which has in the past been referred to as ''games with moving costs'' and ''request-answer games''.<ref>{{harvard citations |last1=Ben David |last2=Borodin |last3=Karp |last4=Tardos |last5=Wigderson |year=1994}}</ref> [[Yao's principle]] is a game-theoretic technique for proving [[Upper and lower bounds|lower bounds]] on the [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] of [[randomized algorithm]]s, especially online algorithms.

The emergence of the internet has motivated the development of algorithms for finding equilibria in games, markets, computational auctions, peer-to-peer systems, and security and information markets. [[Algorithmic game theory]]<ref name="algorithmic-game" /> and within it [[algorithmic mechanism design]]<ref name=r11 /> combine computational [[algorithm design]] and analysis of [[complex system]]s with economic theory.<ref name=r12 />

===Philosophy===
{{Payoff matrix |Name=[[Stag hunt]] | 2L=Stag |2R=Hare |1U=Stag |UL=3, 3 |UR=0, 2 |1D=Hare |DL=2, 0 |DR=2, 2}}
Game theory has been put to several uses in [[philosophy]]. Responding to two papers by {{harvard citations|txt=yes|first=W.V.O.|last=Quine|author1-link=Willard Van Orman Quine|year=1960|year2=1967}}, {{Harvtxt|Lewis|1969}} used game theory to develop a philosophical account of [[Convention (norm)|convention]]. In so doing, he provided the first analysis of [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] and employed it in analyzing play in [[coordination game]]s. In addition, he first suggested that one can understand [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] in terms of [[signaling games]]. This later suggestion has been pursued by several philosophers since Lewis.<ref>({{Harvtxt|Skyrms|1996}}, {{harvard citations |txt=yes |last1=Grim |last2=Kokalis |last3=Alai-Tafti |last4=Kilb |last5=St Denis |year=2004}}).</ref> Following {{Harvtxt|Lewis|1969}} game-theoretic account of conventions, Edna Ullmann-Margalit (1977) and [[Cristina Bicchieri|Bicchieri]] (2006) have developed theories of [[social norms]] that define them as Nash equilibria that result from transforming a mixed-motive game into a coordination game.<ref>{{citation |first=E. |last=Ullmann-Margalit |title=The Emergence of Norms |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1977 |isbn=978-0198244110}}</ref><ref>{{citation |first=C. |last=Bicchieri |title=The Grammar of Society: the Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0521573726}}</ref>

Game theory has also challenged philosophers to think in terms of interactive [[epistemology]]: what it means for a collective to have common beliefs or knowledge, and what are the consequences of this knowledge for the social outcomes resulting from the interactions of agents. Philosophers who have worked in this area include Bicchieri (1989, 1993),<ref>{{citation |title=Self-Refuting Theories of Strategic Interaction: A Paradox of Common Knowledge |journal=Erkenntnis |volume=30 |issue=1–2 |year=1989 |pages=69–85 |doi=10.1007/BF00184816 |last1=Bicchieri |first1=Cristina}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last1=Bicchieri |first1=Cristina |author1-link=Cristina Bicchieri |title=Rationality and Coordination |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-57444-0 |year=1993}}</ref> [[Brian Skyrms|Skyrms]] (1990),<ref>{{citation |title=The Dynamics of Rational Deliberation |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0674218857}}</ref> and [[Robert Stalnaker|Stalnaker]] (1999).<ref>{{citation |chapter=Knowledge, Belief, and Counterfactual Reasoning in Games |editor-first=Cristina |editor-last=Bicchieri |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Jeffrey |editor3-first=Brian |editor3-last=Skyrms |title=The Logic of Strategy |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0195117158}}</ref>

In [[ethics]], some (most notably David Gauthier, Gregory Kavka, and Jean Hampton) {{Who|date=July 2012}} authors have attempted to pursue [[Thomas Hobbes]]' project of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the [[prisoner's dilemma]] present an apparent conflict between morality and self-interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an important component of this project. This general strategy is a component of the general [[social contract]] view in [[political philosophy]] (for examples, see {{Harvtxt|Gauthier|1986}} and {{Harvtxt|Kavka |1986}}).<ref>For a more detailed discussion of the use of game theory in ethics, see the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-ethics/ game theory and ethics].</ref>

Other authors have attempted to use [[evolutionary game theory]] in order to explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding animal behaviors. These authors look at several games including the prisoner's dilemma, [[stag hunt]], and the [[Nash bargaining game]] as providing an explanation for the emergence of attitudes about morality (see, e.g., {{harvard citations|txt=yes|last=Skyrms|year=1996|year2=2004}} and {{harvard citations|txt=yes|last1=Sober|last2=Wilson|year=1999}}).

* The 1959 [[military science fiction]] novel ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] mentioned "games theory" and "theory of games".<ref>{{citation |last=Heinlein |first=Robert A. |title=Starship Troopers |year=1959}}</ref> In the 1997 film of the same name, the character Carl Jenkins referred to his military intelligence assignment as being assigned to "games and theory".
* The 1964 film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' satirizes game theoretic ideas about [[deterrence theory]]. For example, nuclear deterrence depends on the threat to retaliate catastrophically if a nuclear attack is detected. A game theorist might argue that such threats can fail to be ''credible'', in the sense that they can lead to [[Subgame perfect equilibrium|subgame imperfect equilibria]]. The movie takes this idea one step further, with the Russians irrevocably committing to a catastrophic nuclear response without making the threat public.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
* The 1980s [[power pop]] band [[Game Theory (band)|Game Theory]] was founded by singer/songwriter [[Scott Miller (pop musician)|Scott Miller]], who described the band's name as alluding to "the study of calculating the most appropriate action given an adversary... to give yourself the minimum amount of failure."<ref name=intpacsun>{{cite news|last=Guzman|first=Rafer|title=Star on hold: Faithful following, meager sales|date=March 6, 1996|journal=[[Pacific Sun (newspaper)|Pacific Sun]]}} {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106223809/http://www.loudfamily.com/old/intpacsun.html |date=2013-11-06 |title=Copy of interview }}.{{cbignore}}</ref>
* ''[[Liar Game]]'', a 2005 Japanese [[manga]] and 2007 television series, presents the main characters in each episode with a game or problem that is typically drawn from game theory, as demonstrated by the strategies applied by the characters.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
